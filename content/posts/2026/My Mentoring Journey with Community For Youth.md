Mentoring with Community For Youth changes lives -- it changed mine! It made me more accountable, so I can be true to my word and bring my authentic self. It also taught me to get comfortable being uncomfortable and the power of vulnerability. CFY mentor training and experience also prepared me to be a better mentor as a leader throughout my career.

I was a youth mentor for the nonprofit Community For Youth (CFY) in Seattle for 10 years. What kept me going as a mentor for 10 years? Well, there are both "unselfish" and "selfish" reasons. My "unselfish" reasons were to give back to the community where I live and do something meaningful. However, I got so much in return from the amazing, *powerful* community of mentors and students! Some of my "selfish" reasons to stay with CFY were: the inspiring students, the personal growth I experienced, the supportive community (some of the most kind-hearted people I've ever met), and the *fun* you get to have!

Mentoring can be fun! I value joy and play. At CFY, the most memorable part of the program is going to camp to kick off the year. You work and play hard at camp, getting to know the students and mentors so that you can find your match - and your match can find you. I found that connections and earning trust are easier (and more enjoyable) when you hang out and have fun together. One year, the mentors in my "family group" took students to "Fright Night," where we experienced the thrills of the Wild Waves amusement park in the spooky darkness.

For anyone on the fence about mentoring, I recommend not overthinking it. Youth are looking for someone who *shows up* and is there when they need them. You can be that consistent, positive connection! Couldn't we all use that in our lives?

Mentoring youth is a hard job, but the "C" in CFY is *community* - there to support you and your student."
