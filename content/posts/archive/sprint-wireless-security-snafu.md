Someone in their infinite wisdom at Sprint set up an IVR that you can call (intended for internal care reps for identity verification) and get anyone's CPNI/PII by simply keying in their sprint wireless phone number.  
  
Really convenient for Sprint employees and the public -- and really stupid on all counts.
