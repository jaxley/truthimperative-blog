[43 Things](http://www.43things.com/ "43 Things")  
  
"Discover what's important, make it happen, share your progress. Find your 43 things."  
  
I just came across this site. Seems like a fun idea. You can add your own thing that "you want to do with your life" or see what other people said and use those ideas. You can track your progress. Larger fonts indicate more popular topics in the list. There are thousands of people from around the world on there. It also shows "People doing this are also doing these things", which is interesting as well.
