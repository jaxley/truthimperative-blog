This is really stupid. To single out only certain members of the church? I agree with Steve,

And why just pro-life stances? Isn't the catholic doctrine that we are all sinners? In fact, you say before communion "I am not worthy to receive you \[Jesus, via transubstantiation in the body & blood, aka bread & wine\] but only say the word and I shall be healed". You would think that this would be the \_last\_ thing they would want to deny to anyone. But I guess they have to keep up appearances...
