Some good friends of mine have a for-fun cover band they call the 8 Trax.  They are playing two shows July 13 and 14 at Jimmy Jack's.  They are big 60s/70s music fans so prepare for Freebird, lots of Zeppelin, AC/DC, and more.  It's always a fun time and looking at the location, there should be some fun people-watching as well.
