[SSH Filesystem](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html "SSH Filesystem")  
  

> This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol. Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do. On the client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the server with ssh.

  
  
Something to investigate...
