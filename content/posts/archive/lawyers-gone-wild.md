This is an interesting opinion that I think is only potentially applicable to situations where the lawyer in question is representing the company's explicit interest. I haven't seen this happen in general though--particularly where the corporate lawyers are addressing issues that are \_not\_ in regards to the company interest (e.g. privacy law).  
  
For the most part, I have seen these lawyers define a very low bar for a company to meet. The same tendency for lawyers "tend to wield power disproportionate to their duties" (I would use the word "influence" instead of power) leads to these proclamations to be interpreted to mean that the company should only meet the minimum bar. These lawyers are not in the business of suggesting what the company \_should\_ do, only a minimum of what it \_has\_ to do. Laws aren't necessarily sufficient or detailed enough to ensure that they are complied with, however. I have had several situations where lawyers have undone good security work because they proliferated the fact that the law didn't require the proscribed procedures, even though those procedures were in place to uphold that law. Lawyers seem to wield more influence than security folks though so who do you think was listened to?
