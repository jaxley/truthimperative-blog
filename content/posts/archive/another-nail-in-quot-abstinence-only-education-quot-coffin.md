[Abstinence Education Does Not Impact Sexual Beahvior](http://www.rxpgnews.com/health/Abstinence_Education_Programs_Have_No_Impact_on_Sexual_Beahviour_23770.shtml)  
  
  

> A recent study of four abstinence education programs finds that the programs had no effect on the sexual abstinence of youth. But it also finds that youth in these programs were no more likely to have unprotected sex, a concern that has been raised by some critics of these programs. The study found that youth in the four evaluated programs were no more likely than youth not in the programs to have abstained from sex in the four to six years after they began participating in the study. Youth in both groups who reported having had sex also had similar numbers of sexual partners and had initiated sex at the same average age.

  
  
When will the religious nuts give up on "abstinence only" education?! It is hurting the youth they think they are protecting. There have been other studies in the past that confirm this result as well. Enough already!
