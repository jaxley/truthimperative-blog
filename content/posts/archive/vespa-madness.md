A must have: [Vespa Screensaver](http://www.vespausa.com/Downloads/screensaver_vespa.zip). Windows-only, of course.

Interested in buying one for me? I could handle the platinum, dragon red, or cobalt blue one. The local [dealer location](http://www.vespausa.com/Locations/images/maps/bigpeople_map_big.gif)  
  
Or, I can at least hope to [win](http://www.vespausa.com/starbucks.cfm) one from Starbucks. This is the perfect excuse to buy more coffee :-)
