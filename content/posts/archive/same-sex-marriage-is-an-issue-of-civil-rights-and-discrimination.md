[Marriage Rights](https://atrios.blogspot.com/2004/11/marriage-rights-re-run.html "Marriage Rights")  
  
Summary of benefits of marriage that same sex couples are being denied.  
  
The typical talking point of the gay bigots is that "marriage" is a "sacred institution". But those assholes are guilty of [equivocating](https://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2002/07/24.html) (i.e. a logical fallacy, not to mention dishonesty). There are two completely separate concepts involved: Religious definition of marriage (which is not at all within the domain of government and is in no way changed by what the state decides to allow or not) and the [Legal/Stata/Contractual definition](https://www.lectlaw.com/def2/m087.htm) of marriage, which is entirely secular and pragmatic.
