[Crimeware coverage by Scientific American](https://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=the_rise_of_crimeware&more=1&c=1&t "Crimeware coverage by Scientific American")  
  
Crimeware coverage by Scientific American. Several good stats and comments from attendees of the RSA Conference. Why the increase in crime on the Internet? Well, it's where the money is and there is very little risk of getting caught. Job security for a security guy like me though.
