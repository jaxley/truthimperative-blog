This is a fascinating video.  Abortion protesters are asked what should be done to the women who would have illegal abortions.  None of them had an answer and none of them had ever thought about it.  It was hilarious to see them come up with arguments as to why women should actually \_not\_ be punished if they were to have an illegal abortion.  They are quick to make an analogy to abortion and killing a child, but they are very reticent to make the penalties the same.  One even said something to the effect that "it would depend on the situation" and the woman's mental state of mind.  Wowzers.  

> ""**Did you know you can stump anti-abortionists with one simple question?"**  They know it’s absurd and unfair — which means _they know abortion is not really murder_."
