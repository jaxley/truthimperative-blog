[O'Reilly compared Irish immigration to enslavement of African-Americans](http%3A//mediamatters.org/items/200510060002 "O'Reilly compared Irish immigration to enslavement of African-Americans")  
  
O'Reilly actually says this. He started talking about his family's plight when the Irish famine was going on, "everybody was starving in Ireland. They had to leave the country, just as Africans had to leave -- African-Americans had to leave Africa and come over on a boat and try to make in the New World with nothing. Nothing."  
  
Yes, you read that correctly. O'Reilly said that Africans came to america:  
  

  
2.  On a boat ("slave ship" sounds too harsh?)
  
4.  Willingly (refer back to the "slave ship" note)
  
6.  Because they were "starving" (He must have meant when they were on the slave ships stacked one on top of the other like cords of wood)
  
8.  To look for a better life in America (Land of opportunity does not include "forced opportunity")
  
10.  and get this. According to Mr. Bill, it has worked out beautifully for them: They have "succeeded, succeeded. As did Italians, as did -- and I'll submit to you, African-Americans are succeeding as well. So all of these things can be overcome I think"
  

  
  
Yes, when the song "We shall overcome" is sung, it refers to the Great African famine.  
  
Unbelievable
