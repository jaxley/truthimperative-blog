It was unclear from my cursory read of the materials whether machines will require voter verifiable paper audit trails.  At least the Sequoia and Diebold machines must have their ballots hand-counted so it does sound like all-electronic voting is dead for those machines at least.  
  
The full details are available here:  [http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections\_vsr.htm](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_vsr.htm)  
  
Read Rebecca Mercuri's comments in Risks on this announcment:  [California Voting System Hacking Report](http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/24.76.html#subj2.1)  
  
My favorite gem:  
  

> ...let's just throw more money atadditional security mechanisms and training while we all pretend that we'reconducting legitimate elections. Good job, guys, thanks for letting the CASoS off the hook.  
>   
> Here's a novel thought: why not just throw this crap in the junk heap whereit belongs, vote on paper, and let the citizens do the counting? Maybe foranother $1.8M some State can get a team of PhDs to validate that conclusion.

  
[California Puts Limits on Use of E-voting Systems](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=300571&source=rss_topic17)  

> California Secretary of State Debra Bowen has mandated tough new  
> security standards for the state’s e-voting systems and curtailed their  
> planned use after an independent review of the technology.  
>   
> “Citizens do not have confidence that elections have been  
> fairly decided, because they don’t have faith in the integrity of the  
> tools,” Bowen said during a teleconference on Aug. 3.  
>   
> The state will allow e-voting machines made by Diebold  
> Election Systems Inc. and Sequoia Voting Systems Inc. to be used only  
> under strict conditions. Polling stations won’t be able to have more  
> than one of those systems in place, and county registrars will have to  
> take steps such as reinstalling the software and firmware for the  
> devices and resetting their encryption keys.  
>   
> Bowen mandated similar security measures for Hart InterCivic  
> Inc.’s e-voting systems, but without the single-machine limitation. She  
> decertified products from Election Systems & Software Inc. after it  
> was late in providing researchers with access to them. The ES&S  
> systems are being evaluated now and could be approved for use in next  
> year’s presidential primary, she said.  
>   
> E-voting systems were used by one quarter to one-third of California voters in last November’s election, Bowen said.  
>   
> But during a state-sponsored review of the machines and their  
> source code, a team of penetration testers found 15 security problems,  
> including the ability to exploit flaws in Windows.  
>   
> The team reported that it was also able to overwrite  
> firmware, bypass system locks, forge voter cards and install a wireless  
> device on the back of a Diebold server.
