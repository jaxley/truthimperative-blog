[Certifications and Site Trustworthiness](https://www.benedelman.org/news/092506-1.html "Certifications and Site Trustworthiness")  
  
An excellent paper summarizing many of the problems with certifiers such as TRUSTe as well as showing that sites that get these certifications to prove their trustworthiness are actually more likely to _NOT_ be trustworthy!  
  
I know companies who are simply concerned about wanting customers to _\_think\__ that their site was secure that they worked on getting a certification instead of investing in actually _\_making\__ their site secure. No corrective action was taken to align technology or processes to the spirit or letter of the "certification". The same crummy procedures and mindsets that existed before the certification were there after the certification.  
  
I have actually helped fill out the TRUST-e questionnaire the difficulty in answering their survey questions with 100% knowledge of everything that goes on in a company even though it tends to certify the site.
