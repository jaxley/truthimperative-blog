A 2-17-2003 very short Reuters story reports that [Over 5 million Visa/MasterCard accounts hacked into](http://www.forbes.com/markets/newswire/2003/02/17/rtr881826.html)  
  
"More than five million Visa and MasterCard accounts throughout the nation were accessed after the computer system at a third party processor was hacked into, according to representatives for the card association"  
  
This story by the BBC has more [details](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2774477.stm)  
  
Great. Why were the account numbers on Internet-accessible systems. And why were the accounts not stored encrypted at the third party?  
  
5 million accounts is about 1% of the 560 million total cards in circulation. This is huge.
