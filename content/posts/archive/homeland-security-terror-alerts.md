Good to look back on in light of the raising of the alert (and only for public transportation...) Is the best our intelligence can do is to assume that the next attack will be the same MO and style as recent ones?

When Attorney General John Ashcroft came to Minnesota recently, he said the fact that there had been no terrorist attacks in America in the three years since September 11th was proof that the Bush administration's anti-terrorist policies were working. I thought: There were no terrorist attacks in America in the three years before September 11th, and we didn't have any terror alerts. What does that prove?
