[The struggle to find the downside ended in failure at Pandagon](http://pandagon.net/2006/09/14/the-downside-is-elusive-to-me/ "The struggle to find the downside ended in failure at Pandagon")  
  
There are **laws** that prevent some businesses from being open on Sundays??? I thought it was "christian" pandering by businesses. It is really annoying that so many businesses are closed Sundays and if the government is the reason why, then that is appalling.  
  
I like the quote about "God doesn't do well in the free market."
