This is ridiculousness on top of unbelievable ridiculousness and makes me even more pissed about the Bush Administration.  
  
They commute Scooter's sentence before he serves any prison time, then assume he will instead get probation, except you have to serve some time to be eligible for a judge to do that.  So, Scooter may not get anything other than the $250k fine.  Wankers.

> White House Counsel Fred Fielding either did a very shabby or very sneaky job of handling the details of Libby’s commutation, as it is hard to believe that someone as experienced as Fielding wouldn’t anticipate the confusion we see now. I guess it really doesn’t matter to them in the long run, their buddy Scooter will do zero prison time for his part in treasonous crimes against his country while Paris Hilton spent nearly a month in jail for a parole violation. They must be proud…
