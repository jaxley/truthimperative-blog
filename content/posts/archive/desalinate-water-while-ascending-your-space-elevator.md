[Technology Review: Cheap Drinking Water from the Ocean](https://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=16977&ch=nanotech "Technology Review: Cheap Drinking Water from the Ocean")  
  

>   
> A water desalination system using carbon nanotube-based membranes could significantly reduce the cost of purifying water from the ocean. The technology could potentially provide a solution to water shortages both in the United States, where populations are expected to soar in areas with few freshwater sources, and worldwide, where a lack of clean water is a major cause of disease.
