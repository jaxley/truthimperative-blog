[Atheist Ethicist: Well Founded Beliefs](http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/2006/08/well-founded-beliefs.html "Atheist Ethicist: Well Founded Beliefs")  
  
Great treatise on how the inability for people to properly reason (I called it Illogicacy here after Innumeracy) leads them to make terrible mistakes that result in harm to others, often worse than those that society often feels harm society most.  
  
This blog is really, really excellent, BTW. Really makes you think. Sometimes just think that you would have never come up with that or could never have expressed that so logically and eloquently.
