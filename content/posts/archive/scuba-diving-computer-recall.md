From RISKS 25.57.  
  
I have friends who dive and hope to get certified myself soon so this is of particular concern.

Subject: Scuba diving computer recall  
  
\[See also Risks in scuba equipment, Carl Page, RISKS-21.41\]  
  
In simple terms, a dive computer monitors the amount of nitrogen  
dissolved  
in the diver's blood. Typically worn like a wrist watch, it tracks the  
diver's depth and calculates the absorbed nitrogen according to a  
mathematical model of the human body's various tissues.  
  
If a diver surfaces too quickly with too much nitrogen in the body it is  
released as bubbles within the blood or tissues, potentially causing  
injury  
or death through Decompression Sickness (DCS). Divers typically rely  
heavily on a computer to tell them when to surface to avoid DCS.  
  
The manufacturer below is being sued over the mathematical model, which  
has  
a faulty assumption, or more likely a complete oversight. The model  
embedded in this computer assumes that the diver on the surface  
continues to  
breath whatever gas mixture they were diving with. When the diver is  
using  
nitrox, a gas mixture containing extra oxygen and therefore less  
nitrogen  
than air, the computer will assume that they are releasing nitrogen at a  
higher rate than reality. Over several dives and several intervals on  
the  
surface, the state of the mathematical model and the diver's actual  
nitrogen  
levels may become seriously different, and in the 'wrong' (more risky)  
direction.  
  
A failure of requirements specification or code inspection? The lawsuit  
refers to a 'manufacturing defect'.  
  
I have an interest, since I have a nitrox computer from the same  
manufacturer. Fortunately mine is more recent, and I have not used it  
for  
gases other than air.

Uwatec, Scuba Pro and Johnson Outdoors Subject of Class Action Seeking  
Product Recall; 5 Feb 2003  
Dive industry leaders Uwatec and Scuba Pro, and their parent company,  
outdoor equipment conglomerate Johnson Outdoors, Inc., have been sued in  
federal court by a former authorized reseller, Robert Raimo, seeking a  
mandatory recall of all Aladin Air X Nitrox dive computers manufactured  
before 1 Feb 1996. The suit seeks certification as a class action on  
behalf  
of all owners of the dive computers, and all persons who acted as  
retailers,  
dealers, wholesalers or distributors of the dive computers.  
The suit claims that 1995 model Aladin Air X Nitrox dive computers have  
a  
manufacturing defect that prevents the computer from switching from  
underwater to surface, or air mode when the user returns to the surface.  
As  
a result, the computer continues to calculate a diver's decompression  
obligations as if the diver were breathing enriched air, or nitrox,  
containing as little as 50% nitrogen, while on the surface, instead of  
properly calculating the diver's decompression obligations and  
off-gassing  
while the diver is breathing air, which contains 78% nitrogen. This  
defect  
causes the computer to underestimate residual nitrogen loads, and to  
overestimate the diver's safe repetitive bottom times, thereby  
significantly  
increasing the diver's risk of contracting decompression sickness  
(bends).  
The suit alleges that the defect is likely to affect experienced divers  
making multiple nitrox dives in a single day to maximize bottom time,  
such  
as those conducted on increasingly popular "live-aboard" dive vacations  
in  
exotic locations, far away from the nearest treatment centers capable of  
saving the life of a diver stricken with decompression sickness.  
The so-called "air-switching defect" was first described in an internal  
Uwatec memo dated 30 Jan 1996, which warned one of the company's test  
divers  
about "the faulty Aladin Nitrox". The memo described how to manually  
override the defect so the diver could safely use his computer until it  
was  
replaced by Uwatec. After this memo was sent to Uwatec's U.S.  
management,  
they drafted a product recall notice. However, the suit alleges the  
managers  
were fired before they could issue the recall notice, and the defendants  
have maintained a "conspiracy of silence" ever since.  
Copies of the 1996 memo and recall notice are attached as exhibits to  
the  
complaint and may be viewed on the News section of the Web site of  
Raimo's  
attorney, David Concannon, at www.davidconcannon.com.  
Raimo was stricken with Type II decompression sickness after using a  
1995  
model Aladin Air X Nitrox on four nitrox dives off Bonaire in Apr 2002.  
He  
is the former owner of two retail dive centers in New York.  
According to Concannon, the suit was filed as a class action only after  
Johnson, Scuba Pro and Uwatec rebuffed Raimo's requests that the  
companies  
issue a voluntary recall. The suit was filed in Oakland, California  
because  
four other lawsuits filed by divers alleging they were injured by the  
same  
model computer are currently pending there and are scheduled for trial  
in  
Nov 2003.
