Here's a challenge to WSDOT:  Are you willing to halt and reverse the variable speed limit signage deployment if, after a set amount of time, there has not been a significant reduction in congestion-related collisions?  Or, if the new signage actually causes more congestion or more collisions?  
  
All too often the readerboards that give information on accidents seem to slow traffic down even more.  
  
[WSDOT - I-90 - Two-Way Transit and HOV Operations - Variable Speed Limit Signs](https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Projects/I90/TwoWayTransit/vsl.htm)  

> Tried and true on our mountain passes  
> WSDOT uses variable speed limit signs on US 2 at Steven Pass and on I-90 at Snoqualmie Pass to alert drivers to slow down during icy, snowy and congested driving conditions. Similar signs installed on European urban roadways incresed safety and decrease congestion-related collisions by 30% or more.
