An earlier response.

Oh, brother.  There is nothing wrong with this country except that we  
need a do-something congress and to way 468 days for a new president.  
We live in a pluralistic society.  We do NOT live in a Christian  
nation, although there are those in the American Taliban who would love  
a theocracy as much as the Islamic extremists.  
  
There are millions of MUSLIMS who are also AMERICANS.  The two are not  
mutually-exclusive.  
  
The atrocities described below were the result of EXTREMISM; the acts  
are generally known to be incompatible with traditional ISLAM teachings  
so they are not condoned by most MUSLIMS--only a radical extreme  
group.  And let us not ignore how the below comes off as CHRISTIAN  
EXTREMISM EQUALLY AS ABHORRENT AS MUSLIM EXTREMISM (death to the  
infidels and all that.  The below reads as if it could have simply said  
"death to the muslims").  
  
The swath below uses anecdotes to try to make it seem as if MUSLIMS are  
somehow not worthy of any dignity or respect.  A similar list could be  
written about CHRISTIANS, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have  
Christmas stamps, does it?  For example:  
  
The Christian Crusades from 1095-1272 resulted in the deaths of 1  
million people  
  
The Spanish inquisition from 16th-18th century resulted in the deaths  
of 350,000 people.  Many were also tortured by some of the most hideous  
methods ever devised and carried out by the clergy.  
  
The Witch Hunts from the 15th-17th century resulted in the deaths of  
about 100,000 people  
  
The Irish Republican Army (IRA) bombed and killed many in the disputes  
between Protestants and Catholics.  
  
Abortion clinics have been bombed and doctors shot dead by religious  
extremists.  
  
...all in the name of religion.  And this email wants to keep the  
Crusades going I guess.  
  
Or, maybe we can look inward before we "cast the first stone" at those  
of other faiths and ethnicities  
  
Remember the AMERICAN bombing of Oklahoma City?  
Remember the AMERICAN UNABOMBER attacks?  
Remember the AMERICAN and CHRISTIAN Olympic Park Bombings?  
Remember the AMERICAN KKK lynchings and other domestic terrorist  
attacks?  
  
This kind of us vs. them mentality and religious intolerance,  
xenophobia, hatred, and ignorance is exactly what drives the extremists  
all religions.  I'll bet there's a version of this substituting  
CHRISTIAN below circulating around Al-Qaeda training camps.  
  
I ask:  when can we all at least act like Christians and "love thy  
neighbor"?
