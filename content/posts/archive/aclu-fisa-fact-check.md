Good to check out what kind of wool the Bush administration is trying to pull over your eyes on FISA.&nbsp; And the weanie democrats in the House seem to be following in the (lack of lead) of the Senate democrats and seem likely to give the telecoms retroactive immunity **_\_even though nobody (not even the senators voting) knows what exactly they have done or for how long or under what circumstances\__**  
  
You'd think they would want to find out what they are granting immunity for first, right?
