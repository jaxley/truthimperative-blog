[White House has bigger credibility problem than CBS](https://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05012/440801.stm "White House has bigger credibility problem than CBS")  
  
"What happens when you base a big project on questionable information?  
  
Well, if you work for CBS News, you get a pink slip. If you work for George W. Bush, you get a promotion or a medal."  
  
Makes me sick.
