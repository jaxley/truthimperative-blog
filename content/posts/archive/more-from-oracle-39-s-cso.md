Wow. Note how she says that she researches "hacking techniques" as well as the network-security-centric language throughout. A CSO should not typically be operating at this level but rather at the "big picture" strategic level.  
  
No wonder Oracle continues having application security and [patch quality problems](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1874134,00.asp). Their CSO seems too busy hacking the network and writing articles about it and how bad vulnerability researchers are and not enough time executing on a strategy to improve the security posture of their software and processes. Some on security mailing lists are [calling for her to resign](http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-5916171.html).
