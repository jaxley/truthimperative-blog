Wow. This may help spur other cost-conscious companies (perhaps my employer too) into making the switch.  
  
"Currently, our order management, customer transaction information, manufacturing flow, and software downloads (as a part of our build-to-order manufacturing process) all involve Sun-based Unix systems. But that's all being moved to Dell-based systems running Red Hat Linux and Oracle 9iRAC. So far, 14 Sun systems are gone and the plans are to complete the 'Sun setting' exercise this year."
