This is a great development.  The main thing I used GreatNews for was its ability to sync and view postings offline (although many RSS feeds are lame and truncate the stories...)  Of course, GreatNews doesn't work on Linux so Google Reader can now be my main feed reader.  It's great for podcasts too if you want to listen on the PC.  
  
Of course, Google's delivery of the firefox extension is from a non-SSL link...  See [slight paranoia: A Remote Vulnerability in Firefox Extensions](https://paranoia.dubfire.net/2007/05/remote-vulnerability-in-firefox.html) for why this can be hazardous to your computer's health.

> Google Gears, a browser plugin that enables offline web applications. Once you've installed Google Gears, you can download your latest 2,000 items so they're available even when you don't have an internet connection. To get started, simply click the "Offline" link in the top right of Google Reader.
