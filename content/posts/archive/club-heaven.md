75% of Americans think they'll get into Heaven?  They must be Evangelicals whose sole criteria is "belief" and not "good deeds"...  At least I'll have lots of friends in hell.

> Who gets in is another matter. Among people who believe in heaven, one in four thinks access is limited to Christians. More than a third of Protestants feel that way, and this view peaks at 55 percent among Protestants who describe themselves as very religious.
