The BSA (Business Software Alliance) is now taken to sending out threatening letters based on the results of a web/ftp spider search for the word "Office". The RIAA has done similar things in searching for "pirated" music by keyword and then automatically mailing.  
  
From the BSA letter:  
  
"What was located as infringing content:  
\------------------------------  
Filename: /mandrake\_current/SRPMS/OpenOffice.org-1.0.1-9mdk.src.rpm (199,643kb)  
Filename: /mandrake\_current/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/OpenOffice.org-libs-1.0.1-9mdk.i586.rpm (35,444kb)"

Anyone have a clue stick handy?
