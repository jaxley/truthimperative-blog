My sister (who is pregnant) just found out what is seemingly nonintuitive to anyone -- Peanut Butter is a controlled substance (by the TSA).  You can bring it on board, but it can only be in a 3 oz container or smaller.  What???  This kind of insanity has to stop.  
  
  
[TSA: What To Know Before You Go](https://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/prohibited/permitted-prohibited-items.shtm#10)  

> Canned or jarred goods such as soup, sauces, peanut butter, fruits, vegetables and jellies Yes - 3 oz. or smaller container  

  
Bruce Schneier wrote recently about how this kind of thing (no consequences for trying and failing to bring such contraband on board) is actually harmful to the stated goals of airport security.
