[Fox and the Clinton Interview: Hanlon’s Razor](http://www.hanlonsrazor.org/2006/09/25/fox-and-the-clinton-interview/ "Fox and the Clinton Interview: Hanlon’s Razor")  
  
This was a long-overdue smackdown by Clinton after being sandbagged on Fox. They forced YouTube to take down the video clip--trying to rewrite history. Stephanie Miller played the audio this morning--are they going to go after her too? Oh no, people will know that Fox is slanted to the right and giving people on the right a pass!
