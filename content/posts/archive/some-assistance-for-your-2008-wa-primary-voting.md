A couple of great resources to help out with your last-minute voting.  
  
[Show My Elections | 2008 Primary](https://votingforjudges.org/08pri/counties.html)  

[Fuse Primary Voter's Guide](https://fusewashington.org/alerts/265/primary2008king) (great summaries of endorsements for judges, which can be difficult at times to know who's better)
