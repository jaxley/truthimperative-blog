[David Brooks: Completely out of touch](http://www.prospect.org/horsesmouth/2006/06/post_129.html#002837 "David Brooks:  Completely out of touch.")  
  
Look at the statistics from three separate polls on how many Americans want a timetable and a withdrawl/draw down soon from Iraq. It's at least half if not a majority of Americans. Yet pundits like Brooks are misrepresenting them.  
  
I also just heard on Air America this weekend in passing that 72% of US military wants a drawdown/timetable defined. So the Democrats have been on the right side of the issue as viewed by the American people. Oh, and even "Iraq's national security advisor, Mowaffak Rubaie, has publicly embraced a similar timetable." See [http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-withdrawal25jun25,1,4367170.story?coll=la-news-a\_section](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-withdrawal25jun25,1,4367170.story?coll=la-news-a_section)  
  
I can only hope that this comes back to hurt Republicans in the 2006 election.
