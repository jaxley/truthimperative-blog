What a great find!  "A Guide to Seattle's Free Wireless Coffee Shops"  They even have them categorized by neighborhood and even ones that are open late (it is annoying how much stuff in Seattle seems to close early...)  
  
The beauty of wikis keeps popping up all over the place.  I was just marvelling at how much data there is on the OWASP wiki and how easy it was to share new information.  Now, if there was only a PC interface to your brain so you could actually consume all that data being generated...

> Seattle is rich in good, independent coffee shops that offer free, or mostly free wireless access. This wiki is intended to be a guide to the best places in the city to huddle over a table with your laptop, a cup of something hot, maybe a pastry, and get online.
