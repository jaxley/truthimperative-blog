I just got my second notice about my pending economic stimulus act rebate and saw to my dismay that it divulges the last 4 of my SSN. They mask out all the least-secret parts but leave the last 4 digits. Lame! Look for this format on the right-hand-side of the letter inside the very conspicuous envelope: XXX-XX-1234  
  
So, be sure to shred these notices!
