> If passed by Washington voters, the Defense of Marriage Initiative would:  
>   
> \* add the phrase, “who are capable of having children with one another” to the legal definition of marriage;  
> \* require that couples married in Washington file proof of procreation within three years of the date of marriage or have their marriage automatically annulled;  
> \* require that couples married out of state file proof of procreation within three years of the date of marriage or have their marriage classed as “unrecognized;”  
> \* establish a process for filing proof of procreation; and  
> \* make it a criminal act for people in an unrecognized marriage to receive marriage benefits.
