I've been meaning to share some of my favorite Android apps I use  

[Google Keep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep&hl=en)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this note/task management app.  The user interface is a breeze and simple and integration with [Chrome's version](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep/hmjkmjkepdijhoojdojkdfohbdgmmhki?hl=en) means I have a rapid synchronization anywhere I can log into a browser.  I use it to make simple store lists or to capture ideas that come up or just to take simple notes.  

[TV Show Favs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tvshowfavs)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great way to list out shows that you're interested in and keep track of upcoming episodes and to answer questions like, "When will Walking Dead start up again?"  Can use it to find new popular shows to try out as well with the list of popular shows from other users.  Only thing I wish is if there was a web interface as well.

[Circle Launcher Light](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.dbware.circlelauncher.light)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't like clutter on my computer desktops and I hate that this is the default behavior for Android (littering the screens with icons for every app).  Circle launcher lets you get rapid access to groups of applications without taking up more space than is necessary.  I have one group for Media-related apps, one for general apps, and one for frequent contacts.  There are more options to tweak it than I will ever play with.  The one thing I do wish is for an easier UI to manage adding apps to the lists.  Backup and restore is really useful.

[Can I Stream It?](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cisi.activities)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An app I recently found that makes it really easy to see the top movies at lots of places (like Netflix, Redbox, Google, etc.) as well as to search for TV or movies and find which services carry them on either streaming, purchase or rental and how much so you can find the cheapest way of watching those shows.

[Beyondpod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.beyondpod)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the first apps I purchased, this is a solid podcast app.  Has configurable download schedules and cleanup of podcasts.  Even lets you create virtual "feeds" from files stored locally.  I use this a lot for listening to eBooks from other applications.  I use the sleep timer at night.  And it had synchronization with Google reader and now integrates with Feedly so that your listening/reading status is synchronized with any device connected to the same feed!  There's even an experimental feature to synchronize your place inside podcasts across devices that I haven't had a need to try, but sounds useful.

[1Weather](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.handmark.expressweather)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's pretty and gives you tons of weather detail and weather alerts for one or more locations.

  

Juice Defender

  

I dislike having to use an app like Juice Defender, but I work and live in environments where I get terrible mobile network signal.  My phone wastes tons of battery trying to constantly search for 3G/4G.  So, when I'm at home and
