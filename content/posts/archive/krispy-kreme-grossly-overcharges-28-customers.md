From RISKS 22.61.  
  
"A Krispy Kreme doughnut shop in Albuquerque seemingly greased its coffers  
while figuratively deep-frying over two dozen customers. Irrespective of  
what they ordered, each of 28 customers using a credit card were charged  
EXACTLY $84,213.60 for the purchase. "  
  
The PGN comments simply made the posting though:  
  
\[These charges were actually APPROVED, and of course also blew the  
customers' credit ratings for a few days. Amazing!  
\`\`The $84,000 charge, were it legitimate, would have purchased over  
170,000 ... doughnuts, enough to stretch over 9 miles if placed  
end-to-end.'' ...

A Krispy Kreme doughnut shop in Albuquerque seemingly greased its coffers  
while figuratively deep-frying over two dozen customers. Irrespective of  
what they ordered, each of 28 customers using a credit card were charged  
EXACTLY $84,213.60 for the purchase. KK blamed Heartland Payment Systems,  
which processes their credit-card transactions. \[Source: KRQE News 13,

(But a few days later, the doughnuts might have settled into substantial  
paving bricks. Or do Krispy Kremes have a shelf-life of years, like  
the bread and chocolate used in Des(s)ert Shield?) Of course, stacked  
vertically, they would reach almost 2 miles high.  
Somehow, the name \`\`Heartland'' seems incompatible with the concept of  
Krispy Kremes, unless it is related to a hospital with the same name.
