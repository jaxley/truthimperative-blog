One example: [http://bankinfosecurity.com/node/2696](http://bankinfosecurity.com/node/2696)  
  
Isn't "Global pandemic" a bit redundant? Also, is the term "pandemic" even appropriate, or the most appropriate, to describe an Internet-based malady? Pandemic implies distribution over a large _geographic_ area.  
  
Plenty more [http://news.google.com/news?q=pandemic&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=nn&oi=newsr](http://news.google.com/news?q=pandemic&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=nn&oi=newsr)  
  
And thankfully I found this article criticizing this trend: [The 'Pandemic' Epidemic](http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2005/11/the_pandemic_ep.html)
