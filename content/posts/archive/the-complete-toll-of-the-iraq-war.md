It really miffs me to hear media focus entirely on the number of death-specific casualties of the Iraq war but completely ignore the other horrible casualties. From the McLaughlin Group, 11/4/05:  
  

>   
> MR. MCLAUGHLIN: Okay, the human toll: The U.S. military dead in Iraq, including suicides, 2,035; U.S. military amputeed, wounded, injured, mentally ill, 48,100; Iraqi civilians dead, 117,700.  

  
  
Note to the media: Why don't you ask yourselves why it is only the number of \_dead\_ servicemen who you choose to highlight? Isn't **48,100 WOUNDED US CITIZENS** an even more horrific number? Yes, 2035 dead US Citizens is tragic, but death is not the only tragic consequence for the soldiers.  
  
And what about the Iraqi \_deaths\_ of 117,700? That's not their wounded count. That's the number of body bags needed or graves to be dug.
