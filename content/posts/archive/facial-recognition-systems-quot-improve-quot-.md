[\[IP\] NIST rates facial recognition systems](http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200303/msg00269.html "[IP] NIST rates facial recognition systems")  
  
  
  
"The three top-rated systems verified identities correctly 87 percent to 90 percent of the time with a false-alarm rate of 1 percent. When NIST specified a false-alarm rate of 0.1 percent, the success rate dropped to between 79 percent and 82 percent."  
  
From the [report](http://www.frvt.org/FRVT2002/documents.htm) itself:  
  
"Typically, the watch list task is more difficult than the identification or verification tasks  
alone. Figure 8 shows detection and identification rates for varying watch list sizes at a false alarm rate of 1%. For the best system using a watch list of 25 people, the detection and identification rate is 77%. Increasing the size watch list to 3,000 people, decreases the detection and identification rate to 56%."  
  
This means that such systems would still result in fingering plenty of innocent people as terrorists.  
  
A practical, statistical look at the civil rights implications of this problem, endemic to the NCIC database as well, can be found in [the April 2003 Crypto-Gram](http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0304.html#7)  
  
In related news, from an earlier Crypto-Gram:  
  
"The SmartGate facial recognition trial at Sydney Airport has suffered  
an embarrassing setback, when two Japanese visitors fooled the system  
simply by swapping passports.
