[BlackBox Voting](https://www.blackboxvoting.com) is reporting on a [whistleblower lawsuit](https://www.blackboxvoting.com/votehere-lawsuit-1a.html) filed here in Washington state by a software engineer against his former employer [VoteHere](https://votehere.net). He alleges that he was wrongfully terminated to silence his complaints while third party "certification" of the VoteHere system was being conducted. The lawsuit enumerates many of the system's flaws that he documented in defect reports. It is a must-read.  
  
In other unbelievable news, Santa Clara County, CA and Collins County, TX both voted for electronic voting machines without paper audit trails against all sound advice from experts around the world. Santa Clara County reportedly cited the same kinds of "certifications" as evidence that the system is okay without the voter verifiable audit trail.
