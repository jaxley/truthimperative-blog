[DailyTech - Update: AMD Plans Major CPU Price Drops Day After "Conroe"](https://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=2800 "DailyTech - Update: AMD Plans Major CPU Price Drops Day After ")  
  
Guess I'll have to wait to buy my new system! I'm thinking an AMD AM2 motherboard will have the best socket longevity and that is the socket platform that AMD is putting its lower power consumption options on. Comparable CPUs run 89W or less in the AM2 version versus the Socket 939 equivalents. And even lower power consumption models are on the way.  
  
If the prices do drop this dramatically, I'm not sure if I would buy a better proc or take advantage of the cheap price/performance option. We'll see.
