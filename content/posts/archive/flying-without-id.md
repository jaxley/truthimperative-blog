Legally, there is no requirement that you must have an ID to fly in the US. However, you may encounter lots of resistance. That's why I, as a security professional, have not yet attempted to do so. My wife would probably not be as interested as I am in the answer...  
  
Seems as if the TSA may even have different procedures for those who \_forget\_ their IDs than for those who \_refuse to show\_ ID. Funny. It is also noted that if they write SSSS on your boarding pass for "special screening", if you were to have another copy of your boarding pass without the SSSS you may be able to bypass the extra screening.
