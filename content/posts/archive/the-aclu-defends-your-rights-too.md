This is also one that puzzles me.  I think it is primarily that some people dislike some of the causes that the ACLU has taken up (e.g. against ridiculous religious wackos trying to instill their brand of religion or morality as the law of the land) and so they discard the whole organization out of pocket.  But their slogan, "Freedom can't defend itself" speaks to exactly what they are here for:  to defend [The Bill of Rights](https://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/funddocs/billeng.htm).  You know, the Bill of Rights is what gives the religious people their freedom to practice religion.  Too bad they don't see that the ACLU is also fighting for their rights too.

> In terms of venerable institutions that are the target of right wing rage, the one that always puzzled me the most is the ACLU. I mean, I don’t doubt why it’s the target of so much hatred—wingnuts are well-known for thinking the word “freedom” looks good on a bumper sticker but shoudn’t actually be practiced as a matter of policy—but I’m shocked that even mainstream Republican politicians indulge in blatant disdain for an institution that defends the most fundamental principles of our democracy. The facade that Republicans care about individual liberty completely falls apart when Bush Sr. use the term “card-carrying member of the ACLU” as an insult.

By the way, our [founding fathers](https://freethought.mbdojo.com/foundingfathers.html) were primarily [Deists;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism) we are not a Christian nation.
