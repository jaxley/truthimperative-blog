There is a [story](http://www.acm.org/membernet/stories/usacm_01-03.html) in this month's ACM MemberNet publication on the ACM's opposition to Total Information Awareness (TIA).  
  
This isn't exactly news, because the ADM [letter](http://www.acm.org/usacm/Letters/tia_final.html) was drafted on Jan 23. The latest status on the [EPIC TIA page](http://www.epic.org/privacy/profiling/tia/) was Jan 24 when Amendment 59 was included in a bill to impose limits on TIA. However, the requirement that the government simply provide a report in order to continue funding seems weak. There isn't anything defining what content within the report would be satisfactory. It sounds too much like corporate privacy policies. It doesn't matter what is in them, so long as the company abides by it. The report could say exactly what privacy advocates fear most and TIA will still be funded. However, the catch-all requiring congress to approve use of TIA is a step in the right direction.
