In response to a moveon.org phone campaign, this is the message that I communicated to Obama's campaign staff.  
  
"The FISA bill is something that I am very concerned about. I know that Barack has said that he is not fond of the immunity provisions in the FISA bill. I wanted to call to encourage Barack to take a stand unlike many of the other Democrats who have voted for this bill in the past and also take a stand for the rule of law. We know this is something that the current administration cannot be counted on to do and we are looking for Obama to change that."
