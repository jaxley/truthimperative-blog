This is completely counter-intuitive.  The OpenOffice dialog for conditional formatting only lets you select from pre-defined "styles" by name (no autopreview) and no way to add a new style from the dialog.  I had to google this to find out how to modify existing styles.  Oy.  Sometimes the MS way is the better way...
