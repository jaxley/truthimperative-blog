Catholic Apologetics International is challenging people to provide [proof that the earth revolves around the sun](http://www.catholicintl.com/epologetics/articles/science/geochallenge.htm).  
  

>   
> CAI will write a check for $1,000 to the first person who can prove that the earth revolves around the sun. (If you lose, then we ask that you make a donation to the apostolate of CAI). Obviously, we at CAI don't think anyone CAN prove it, and thus we can offer such a generous reward. In fact, we may up the ante in the near future.  

  
  
Why are they doing this, well one reason:  
  

>   
> if it can be proven that, after the Church clung so tenaciously to the view that the sun revolves around the earth, but that now the Church finally has to admit she was wrong about one of its more authoritative teachings in the seventeenth century, this does not bode well for convincing modern man to abide by the Church's official teaching on ANY issue.
