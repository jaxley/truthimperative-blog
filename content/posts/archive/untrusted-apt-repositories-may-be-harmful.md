Something to keep in mind the next time you take a shortcut and add a new repository to get the latest & greatest software for your linux distro.  Sometimes it is better to apt-get source <pkg name> and run run debian rules binary to get your own packages.  Of course, that's not quite working for me with Thunderbird 2 right now...
