Wow.  Was just recalling how a mirror on the passenger seat of my grandparents' car burned a hole in the dashboard on a sunny day when I was a kid.  Was a reminder to not leave mirrors attached inside the vehicle (even though having one to watch our little cutie would be handy)  
  
[Sunlight, Water, Bowl Likely Cause Of Bellevue Fire - Seattle News Story - KIRO Seattle](http://www.kirotv.com/news/19497842/detail.html)  

> BELLEVUE, Wash. -- Investigators suspect sunlight was the cause of a fire that destroyed a deck and kitchen in an east Bellevue home on Sunday, said Lt. Eric Keenan of the City of Bellevue.  
>   
> A glass bowl partially filled with water elevated on a wire rack in a sunny area of the home’s deck provided the right conditions to focus the sunlight and start a fire, Keenan said.  
>   
> The fire occurred shortly before 3 p.m. Sunday in the 17100 block of Northeast Fifth Street.  
>   
> The homeowners were away from the house when neighbors noticed flames and smoke.  
>   
> Bellevue firefighters were able to extinguish the fire without injuries, and the family dog was rescued, but damage to the home is estimated at about $215,000.
