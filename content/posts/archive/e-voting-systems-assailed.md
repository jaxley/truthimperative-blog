A great article with some perfect quotes from leading advocates and experts for voter verifiable audit trails. Also, there are some documented cases of voting machine errors in the article.

New Voting Systems Assailed  
Computer Experts Cite Fraud Potential

As election officials rush to spend billions to update the country's  
voting machines with electronic systems, computer scientists are  
mounting a challenge to the new devices, saying they are less reliable  
and less secure from fraud than the equipment they are replacing.  
  
...  
  
"These systems, because of the level of testing they go through, are  
the most reliable systems available," said Michael Barnes, who oversaw  
Georgia's statewide upgrade. "People were happy with how they  
operated."  
  
....  
  
But the scientists' campaign, which began in California's Silicon  
Valley in January, has gathered signatures from more than 300 experts,  
and the pressure has induced the industry to begin changing course.  
  
....  
  
Critics of such systems say that they are vulnerable to tampering, to  
human error and to computer malfunctions -- and that they lack the  
most obvious protection, a separate, paper receipt that a voter can  
confirm after voting and that can be recounted if problems are  
suspected.  
  
Officials who have worked with touch-screen systems say these concerns  
are unfounded and, in certain cases, somewhat paranoid.  
  
David Dill, the Stanford University professor of computer science who  
launched the petition drive, said, "What people have learned  
repeatedly, the hard way, is that the prudent practice -- if you want  
to escape with your data intact -- is what other people would perceive  
as paranoia."  
  
Other computer scientists, including Rebecca Mercuri of Bryn Mawr  
College, say that problems are so likely that they are virtually  
guaranteed to occur -- and already have.  
  
...  
  
"If the only way you know that it's working incorrectly is when  
there's four votes instead of 1,200 votes, then how do you know that  
if it's 1,100 votes instead of 1,200 votes? You'll never know," said  
Mercuri.  
  
Because humans are imperfect and computers are complicated, said Ben  
Bederson, a professor of computer science at the University of  
Maryland, mistakes will always be made. With no backup to test, the  
scientists say, mistakes will go undetected.  
  
"I'm not concerned about elections that are a mess," Dill said. "I'm  
concerned about elections that appear to go smoothly, and no one knows  
that it was all messed up inside the machine."  
  
"We're not paranoid," said Mercuri. "They're avoiding computational  
realities. That's the computer science part of it. We can't avoid it  
any more than physical scientists can avoid gravity."
