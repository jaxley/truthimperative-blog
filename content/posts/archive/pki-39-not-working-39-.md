I still run into people who believe that PKI is a viable end-user authentication solution for the masses. My favorite were the systems that tried to solve the certificate portability problem by allowing download of certs from a website -- with only a password! The vendor couldn't see that it was no more secure than the password itself. Another case of "But this one goes to 11".
