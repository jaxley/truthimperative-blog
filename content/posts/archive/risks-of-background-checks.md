There is a trend after 9/11 to perform more background checks on individuals as a requirement for all kinds of things--employment being a major. Data integrity issues are probably the biggest risk with these kinds of checks. Who has your data? Where did they get it from? How do you know it is accurate? How can you correct mistakes?  
  
I reviewed a background check service that is used for credit checks mainly and was surprised to see that they offered the ability to check against the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
This is a case of just not doing a very thorough query of the information in the first place. Reminds me of the recent erroneous (and perjurious?) [BSA complaint](/archives/000032.html) against OpenOffice based on an inaccurate search query and lack of human sanity-checking of the result. "The computer said there was a match. And computers don't lie..."

Subject: Identity mixup: NZ teacher identified as prostitute  
  
Michelle Garforth (Dunedin, NZ) applied to be registered as a teacher, after  
finishing four years of training. She was notified that she was "likely" to  
be a prostitute convicted on four charges, including two assaults, based on  
a computer match of her maiden name and birthdate. Despite going to the  
police and submitting to fingerprinting that demonstrated she was not the  
person in question, she was not cleared until weeks later -- after her local  
Member of Parliament had intervened. \[Source: Prostitute mix-up shocks
