[Wired News: Worst Tech Moments 2005](https://wired.com/news/technology/0,69918-0.html?tw=wn_tophead_14 "Wired News: Worst Tech Moments 2005")  
  
Not sure I entirely agree with all of these. Looks like Bush will make the 2006 list several more times given the additional illegal spying uncovered so far. A summary of the list:  
  

  
*   TiVo boxes betray their owners
  
*   Commerce Department blocks .xxx domain
  
*   PayPal blocks Katrina aid
  
*   Space shuttle Discovery
  
*   Bush corrupts the NSA
  

  
  
Here are some items that I predict for the 2006 list:  
  

  
*   [Senator Ted Stevens': The Internet is a series of tubes](https://www.boingboing.net/2006/07/02/sen_stevens_hilariou.html)
  
*   [Senator Inhofe](https://pacinst.org/topics/integrity_of_science/blog/?p=30), Charman of the Environment and Public Works committee, global warming is the [greatest hoax ever](https://www.pacinst.org/topics/integrity_of_science/blog/)
  
*   [Rewriting The Science, Scientist Says Politicians Edit Global Warming Research - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/17/60minutes/main1415985.shtml "Rewriting The Science, Scientist Says Politicians Edit Global Warming Research - CBS News")
  
*   Bush Administration: Generally [anti-science](https://behavioralhealth.typepad.com/markhams_behavioral_healt/2006/03/is_the_bush_adm.html) (ideology trumps science/facts)
  

  
  
I'm sure there are many others. These were off the top of my head.
