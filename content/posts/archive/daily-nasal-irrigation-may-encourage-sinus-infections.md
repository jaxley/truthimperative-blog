A brand new study out shows that using sinus rinsing as a prophylactic may actually have the opposite effect of **_increasing_** your rate of sinus infections.  Significantly.  As much as 50-60+ % more sinus infections.   
  
They did not test efficacy of using sinus irrigation when you actually have a cold or sinus infection so until hard data is out there, it may still be okay.
