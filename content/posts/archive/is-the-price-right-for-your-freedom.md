How do you measure a cost-benefit for the new security measures or of your liberty? It is hard to even come up with a causal link from the "increased" security measures (ask me about the absurd experience I had in LAX...) to increased safety, let alone quantifying such a benefit.  
  
There is also a discussion at [http://www.plastic.com/article.html;sid=03/03/12/06265215;cmt=42](http://www.plastic.com/article.html;sid=03/03/12/06265215;cmt=42)
