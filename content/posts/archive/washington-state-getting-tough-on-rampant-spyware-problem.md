This is a step in the right direction. I am not sure if it will be effective due to jurisdictional and technological issues with tracking, identifying, and prosecuting purveyors of spyware. The anti-spam legislation in the state and federal laws has not exactly dramatically curbed spam. But this clarification of the computer crime statutes is helpful to avoid ambiguity.  
  
Also of interest to me now is that Washington also passed an anti-phishing [law](https://www.leg.wa.gov/pub/billinfo/2005-06/Htm/Bills/Session%20Law%202005/1888-S2.SL.htm).
