I just found out about [Unthirsty](http://www.unthirsty.com/), but even that site now has competition from [MappyHour](http://mappyhour.nerl.net/index.php) -- a Google mashup site with links to happy hour reviews.  
  
But this site is still a great staple:Â  [Seattle Travel's Seattle Happy Hour Guide.](http://seattletravel.com/restaurants/happy-hour/seattle-happyhour-downtown.html) It has happy hours listed by neighborhood.
