Several articles on the topic of the government pushing religion.  
  
Drum-beating about the 9th circuit decision about "Under God" in the pledge:

How did your senator vote on the pledge legislation (" S. Res. 71 As Amended; A resolution expressing the support for the Pledge of Allegiance.")?  
[U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&session=1&vote=00039 "U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote")  
  
[The Sacramento Bee -- sacbee.com -- Diana Griego Erwin: Pledge debate recalls another tradition, another controversy](https://www.sacbee.com/content/news/story/6204199p-7158853c.html "The Sacramento Bee -- sacbee.com -- Diana Griego Erwin: Pledge debate recalls another tradition, another controversy") The best quote is, "the Constitution wasn't written to uphold majority opinion." It was written to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority.  
  

>   
> The 9th Circuit seems to agree. Our Constitution protects the freedom of us all, Jew, Christian, atheist, Muslim, Buddhist or agnostic to pray or keep silent, worship or not, believe or disbelieve. Standing outside the classroom door to avoid participating is exclusionary, especially for children.  
>   
> At my school in the 1960s, one student couldn't pledge allegiance to the flag because her family was Jehovah's Witness. Being children, we thought she was weird. She even seemed less American. She was just a little girl.

  
  
And finally, an article debunking the religious nut talking point that we are a "Christian nation". [The Nation | Article | Our Godless Constitution | Brooke Allen](https://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050221&s=allen "The Nation | Article | Our Godless Constitution | Brooke Allen")
