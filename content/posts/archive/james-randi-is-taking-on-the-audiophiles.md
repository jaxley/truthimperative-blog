This is hilarious.  I feel sorry for people who either really have such extraordinary hearing that they can't use ordinary $19.99 cables in their home theater setup, or have deluded themselves into thinking that they can really tell the difference.  
  
James Randi shows how ridiculous it is to spend $860 a foot for cables.
