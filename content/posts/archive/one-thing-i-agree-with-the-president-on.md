The Daily Show pointed out that in a recent speech on the campaign trail, the president laid out this gem about the recent missing 380 tons of explosives in Iraq:  
  

> "The investigation is important and it's ongoing. And a political candidate who jumps to conclusions without knowing the facts, is not a person you want as your Commander-in-Chief."

  
  
Indeed. At least I can agree with the president on this statement. It does not apply in this context, but there is this debacle going on in Iraq...
