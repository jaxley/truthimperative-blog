Especially heinous I think is the recent [legislation](http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/17/1515231) McCain helped to broker that [suspended habeus corpus](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/9/18/154635/318) for "enemy combatants", and allows torture, among other dreadful things.  I used to like McCain, but now he's pimped himself out for too many political purposes I think.   
  
[Media Matters - Despite McCain's many hedges, Borger asserted that "\[n\]o one would accuse McCain of equivocating on anything"](http://mediamatters.org/items/200610310003)  

> In her latest column, posted online on October 29 and that will appear in the November 6 edition of U.S. News & World Report, U.S. News contributing editor and CBS News national political correspondent Gloria Borger asserted that "\[n\]o one would accuse \[Sen. John\] McCain \[R-AZ\] of equivocating on anything." Writing about the prospect of Sen. Barack Obama's (D-IL) running for president in 2008, Borger contrasted him with McCain, asserting that Obama's "penchant for wishy-washy is well documented." Yet as Media Matters for America has repeatedly noted, despite an abundance of well-documented backtracks, flip-flops, and inconsistencies, the media continue to describe McCain with words such as "honest" and "authentic" and generally regard him as an unwavering purveyor of "straight talk."
