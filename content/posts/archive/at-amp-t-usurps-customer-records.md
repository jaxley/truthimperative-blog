Time to switch your phone company. AT&T rewrote its privacy policy to basically say that your data is theirs and they will do what they please. Some legal manoevering to allow them to continue to sell those records to the NSA to spy on you. All Cingular customers should now be wary since AT&T will own them once the acquisition is complete.  
  
But I guess, what do you expect when we live in a country that doesn't explicitly grant privacy protections like the EU and where privacy is routinely tromped on by companies and the government for their own ends? And when the US public has been trained that this is okay?
