This is enough to make you vomit in your mouth. Yes, we are all having to pay more \_individual\_ taxes to make up for US corporations that use kickbacks and loopholes to avoid paying federal taxes. This should make the anti-tax people irate, especially since we live in a world where corporations are equivalent to individuals from a legal standpoint. How anyone can claim that they pay their fair share is beyond me.
