I got an advertisement for Clearwire wireless broadband to my house that had a terrible Q & A about security:

> Q: How secure is the connection? Is it more secure than Wi-Fi? A: Your Clearwire connection is very secure. That's because Clearwire wireless technology uses OFDM transmission protocol, featuring a design standard that includes secure wireless data transmission.

Well, it starts off not too bad. Very high-level and milquetoast of a response. But unfortunately, they continue:

> Wi-Fi operates on unlicensed 2.4GHz frequencies, making it vulnerable to scanning and packet interception. Clearwire operates at licensed 2.5GHz frequencies. Licensed frequencies and OFDM make for a very secure connection.

Yes. Take your security soma. Don't worry. Where others might have SEcurity, we're leaders in OBscurity.
