A recent MIT [study](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/nr/2003/diskdrives.html) of 129 used hard drives indicated that people leave a treasure trove of data behind on their discarded computers.  
  
This begs the question of how can you securely dispose of old hard drives? Well, the typical answers are to use a secure wiping program or degaussing, but these are not 100% effective.  
  
Some people have come up with a foolproof method called [Drive Slagging](http://driveslag.eecue.com/articles/index.php?artid=1 "Drive Slagging") which involves melting down the platters and essentially creating aluminum ingots.  
  
Not exactly do-it-yourself though :-)
