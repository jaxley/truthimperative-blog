Oh, got another stupid retread of a retread of a chain email that I had to debunk.  Posting to the inter-tubes for the benefit of others.  It seems that when you google shit like this the results tend to be topped with people reposting and rarely with posts intelligently analyzing the statements.  
  
This one was particularly hilarious because if you actually read the sources cited, they tend to contain plenty of information that debunks their own claims!

**Subject:** Re: Fw: WHY ARE WE BANKRUPT?  
"Why isn't this in the papers?"  Because it is chock full of lies and distortions (i.e. it's not true)!  Oh, there are so many things wrong with this that I will point out just a few things.  
  
The first to point out is that you absolutely cannot rely on the claimed "fact-checking" of chain emails.  Unless this was written by your buddy bikemick (it wasn't), and he was the one who did the fact-checking (he didn't), then you are still passing along likely false information.  And much (if not all of this) is false, which implies that probably most of it is false -- no matter how much it agrees with your preconceived notions.  DO YOUR OWN FACT CHECKING or just delete these if you won't be able to vouch for the veracity of the claims.  
  
Let's just start at the beginning.  1.  $11 - 22 billion is spent on welfare for illegal aliens each year.  And they cite a supposed source to back this claim up (which actually then cites another source which DOES NOT back up the data).  The latest data in the study cited is from 2001 and shows 8,274,240,000 (8 billion / year).  The fact that they gave a range of x - 2x should have been a red flag to start with (don't we know these things exactly?)  They wanted to make you think it was high when it isn't that high.  Especially when compared to native and legal immigrant use of welfare, which is respectively 21 times and about 4 times higher than that (or 174 billion and 30 billion respectively)  
  
The bogus figure comes from "FAIR, which has faced bipartisan [accusations](http://colorado.mediamatters.org/rd?http://colorado.mediamatters.org/items/200703280002) of airing "racially inflammatory" anti-immigration ads with another group, the Coalition for the Future of the American Worker."  
  
I also thought you would find it illuminating to consider placing blame on the companies and industries that \_hire\_ illegal immigrant laborers.  Supply and demand folks, and with a complicit government that looks the other way to support business, you get what you get.  Instead of villifying "illegals" who are just trying to feed their families, if you really want to get to the bottom of these problems, you should look at solving the market-driven problem with a market-driven solution.  
  
From the very study that was (misquoted by the first citation below):  

> "If such businesses can only survive by paying poverty-level wages, creating huge costs for taxpayers in the form of welfare payments to their workers, then maintaining such an industry makes little sense. Welfare payments to low-wage workers represent a large subsidy to business. For example, if taxpayers provide health care in the form of Medicaid, then employers do not have to provide health care. Of course, employers find this a very desirable situation. Employers do not see the costs of Medicaid because they are diffuse, borne by all taxpayers, while employers have a very strong incentive to keep down their labor costs by keeping immigration high. By providing workers with welfare and other means-tested programs, taxpayers are in effect paying part of the salary for these workers. Like any business receiving subsidies, those who use unskilled labor will try very hard to retain them. The fact that some businesses wish to retain this subsidy cannot, however, justify the costs to taxpayers, or the reduction in wages for the poorest American workers. "  
>   

Additionally, the title of the CIS study cited below?  "The High Cost of Cheap Labor"  Right.  They are pointing out that this is an economic problem created by a market that is working the way markets work with little oversight from the government.  
The most damning problem of the "facts" below is that they are split out individually, then added up again (double, and maybe even triple counted).  So the "total" is utter bunk.  The CIS study being cited actually contains a realistic figure for the TOTAL:  "Households headed by illegal aliens imposed more than $26.3 billion in costs on the federal government in 2002 and paid only $16 billion in taxes, creating a net fiscal deficit of almost $10.4 billion"  That's right -- a whopping net of 10.4 billion.  _**Not 338 billion**_.  Their data rightly subtracts the $16 billion paid in taxes by illegals.  
  
This email has been on the Internet for years and is now making another round as some sorry person has decided to edit it to make it "current" with the economic crisis at hand.  More debunking here:  [http://colorado.mediamatters.org/items/200707060001](http://colorado.mediamatters.org/items/200707060001)
