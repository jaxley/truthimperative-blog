I find myself reticent to use the word 'skeptic' to describe myself because it is often incorrectly equated to 'cynic' or some other malcontent or negative connotation.  I've used "rigorous doubt" in its stead on occasion since it takes a bit more thought to contemplate and avoids the knee-jerk emotional reaction that can accompany the term 'skeptic'.  
  
But, I came across this quote from Eugenie Scott on Skepchick that nicely summarizes what being a skeptic is and how it is really a neutral position:  

> “Skepticism is a perspective that does not accept or reject claims at face value, but withholds judgment until specific evidence is available.” ~ Eugenie Scott
