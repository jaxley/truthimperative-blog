I heard someone talk about how in the 50's and 60's everyone was building bomb shelters for protection against nuclear attack and fallout but now people are being told that some tarp and duct tape are all that is needed.  
  
The question was asked, "Who is going to protect us from Tom Ridge, and his bumblers in the Dept of Homeland Security..."
