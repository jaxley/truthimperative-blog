Actually, lots of browsers get poor marks overall for how the password management systems function and protect you against malicious attacks.  
  
I'm still floored that Firefox does not have the functionality of the Master Password Timeout extension as a base option.  Otherwise, anyone who walks up to your browser can access any site you visit and log in (if you don't use a master password and/or once you type in the master password once)!  With this extension, you ensure that the exposure is limited to a set time period.  It also helps protect against automated attacks since they can't succeed unless you type your master password in again.
