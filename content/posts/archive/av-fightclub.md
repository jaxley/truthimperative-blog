You get to talk about this Fightclub.  Kaspersky wins again.   
  
I would be somewhat wary of ClamAV though since it seems to suffer from loads of security holes:  [https://secunia.com/product/2538/?task=statistics\_2007](https://secunia.com/product/2538/?task=statistics_2007) versus the Kaspersky results:  [https://secunia.com/product/10470/?task=statistics\_2007](https://secunia.com/product/10470/?task=statistics_2007)  
  
Also, refer back to the previous posting [Juxtaposition: Antivirus bakeoff public results](https://juxtaposition.axley.net/archives/2007/05/antivirus_bakeo_1.html) for another source of AV comparisons.

> Only three (Clam, Kaspersky, Norton) call all of these. Three others (F-Prot, Sophos, Mcafee) missed a few ranging from an 80-90% catch rate - not very good considering these are all really common viruses, but certainly better than others. GlobalHauri and the gateway appliances (Sonicwall, Fortinet, Watchguard) all performed poorly - catching about 60% and less of these common viruses. Watchguard would only catch one virus (the eicar test virus), which is odd because I thought they used the ClamAV engine.
