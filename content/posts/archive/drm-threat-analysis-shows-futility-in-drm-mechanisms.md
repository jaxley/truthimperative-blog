This analysis shows how DRM solutions are ineffective because they \[attempt to\] address the wrong threat model.  
  
"Many DRM advocates make the classic mistake of refusing to choose a threat model. When they complain about the problem, they seem to be using the Napsterization model -- they talk about one infringing copy propagating across the world. But when they propose solutions they seem to be solving the casual-copying problem, asking only that the technology keep the majority of customers from ripping content. So naturally the systems they are building donï¿½t solve the problem they complain about."
