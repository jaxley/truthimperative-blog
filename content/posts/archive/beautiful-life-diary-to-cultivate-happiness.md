From the book [59 Seconds](http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/59-seconds-think-a-little-change-a-lot/) by Richard Wiseman, this is a list of writing topics that you can do over the course of a week -- spending just 59 seconds each day -- to cultivate happiness. And each activity is backed by actual scientific research.  
  
I had intended to do this from early on this year but have not done so. But that's not going to stop me from starting now.  
  

  
*   Monday: **"Thanksgiving"** \[list 3 things\]; be grateful even for small things over past week
*   Tuesday: **"Terrific times in life"**; describe it and how you felt
*   Wednesday: **"Future fantastic"**; imagine life in the future as a realistic reality and write about it
*   Thursday: **"Dear"**; someone dear to you. write a letter to them describing their impact on you and how as if this was the only opportunity to tell them
*   Friday: **"Reviewing the situation"**; reflect over past week and write 1 sentence on why each of 3 things that went well for you and why each turned out so well

  
  
I'd highly, highly recommend this book. It is a fascinating read and has loads of very insightful and useful tips and cuts through the self-help scrap-heap.
