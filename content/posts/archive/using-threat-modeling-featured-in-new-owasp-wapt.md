This will be something to look forward to. I have not seen much of the theory of threat modeling end-to-end put into practice effectively or completely. And much of what I have seen of threat modeling really should be baked into the SDLC process and something that project teams do as part of normal development efforts (why are security people doing separate data flow diagrams, for example?).
