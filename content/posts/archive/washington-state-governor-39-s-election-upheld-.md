Some highlights:  
  

  
*   Bridges: Overturning election would have meant "judicial egotism"  
    Judge Bridges said Republicans did not meet the burden of showing "clear and convincing" proof.  
      
    
*   "There is no evidence in this record that Ms. Gregoire received any illegal votes," he said.  
      
    
*   There is no evidence that the problems in King County had anything to do with "intentional misconduct or someone's desire to manipulate the election" or "partisan bias," the phrase Republicans used to allege wrongdoing.  
      
    
*   "No evidence exists as to which candidate may have received a vote from the provisional ballots not associated with a registered voter."  
      
    

  
  
So, I wish I had heard what Dori Monson's comments were about this...
