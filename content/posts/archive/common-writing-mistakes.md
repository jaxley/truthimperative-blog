This post about [Grammar Nerds](https://whohastimeforthis.blogspot.com/2005/11/grammar-nerds.html) reminded me that I've long wanted to write about some common mistakes I see over and over on the Internet and in emails.  
  
The most common thing that I notice is confusing words that sound somewhat alike but have very different meanings and spellings:  
  

  
*   conscious/conscience
  
If your conscience is bothering you, you are conscious.  
*   effect/affect
  
Will poor grammer affect your chances of getting that next job?  
  
Missing out on that next job may be the likely effect (outcome) of being sloppy with grammar.  
*   console/consul
  
You can change administrative settings via an application or server _console_.  
*   bare/bear
  
Bear in mind these grammar rules for next time.  
*   there/their/they're
  
They're = They are  
  
There = refers to a location (e.g. over there)  
  
Their = a possessive pronoun; used when referring to group possession of a thing or quality  
*   your/you're
  
You're = You are  
  
Your = possessive pronoun; used when referring to someone possessing a thing or quality  
*   e.g./i.e.
  
e.g. = exempli gratia (for example); use when providing an example for clarification  
  
i.e. = id est (that is... or "in effect"); use when providing additional clarifying information, not through the use of an example  
*   lose/loose
  
I always see this one when someone misspells lose as "loose". Playing fast and loose with spelling!  
*   mute/moot
  
When using the phrase, "a moot point" or similar, "this may become moot", moot is the right spelling. Mute refers to remaining or being unable to speak.  
*   to/two/too
  
Too = also  
  
two = the number 2  
  
to = a preposition meaning a variety of things, such as "toward"  

  
  
There are a ton of sites that go into more detail than this. A simple [google search](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=common+mistakes+two+to+too&btnG=Search) will find most all of them. Or just check your favorite dictionary.
