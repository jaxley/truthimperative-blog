Well, "Open Sesame" works if you say it through a nearby walkie-talkie:

> For more than two years, U.S. airplane passengers have flown more securely because high-tech cockpit doors created a barrier to prevent a repeat of 9/11, when terrorists entered the cockpit and commandeered four planes.

So, other on-board avionics and electronics has to meet strict EMI standards to get on an airplane, but not the new cockpit doors??? Let me guess, the Bush Administration and Congress exempted this new equipment from typical safety and other regulations after 9-11 since those aren't important when there are terrorists out there?
