>   
> Results of a study conducted by PrivacyActivism show that data aggregators have significant problems with accuracy and responsiveness, potentially serious issues for an industry already under fire for massive security breaches.  
>   
> 100% of the eleven participants in the study discovered errors in background check reports provided by ChoicePoint. The majority of participants found errors in even the most basic biographical information: name, social security number, address and phone number (in 67% of Acxiom reports, 73% of ChoicePoint reports). Moreover, over 40% of participants did not receive their reports from Acxiom -- and the ones who did had to wait an average of three months from the time they requested their information until they received it.  

  
  
To go along with my other [post](https://juxtaposition.axley.net/archives/000250.html) on data aggregator service efficacy, another set of nails in the coffin. Keep in mind that this is anecdotal. However there was at least another study that I can't find a reference for that found something like 80% of entries had errors.  
  
Anyhow, more fuel to the fire from real-life experience with ChoicePoint data was the voter roll [purging debacle](https://www.sptimes.com/2003/12/21/State/No_telling_if_voter_r.shtml):  
  

>   
> The Department of State awarded a $4-million contract to Boca Raton-based Database Technologies Inc. (now ChoicePoint Inc.) to find improperly registered voters in the state's database. Database Technologies cross-checked voter lists with federal and state databases to find illegal voters by matching names, birth dates and other characteristics.
