I just finally fixed my modified Vixburg style for Movable Type so that it makes use of wider browsers. Many times, quotes or pictures or preformatted text get chopped by the small center column. I tried for hours to get a decent 3 column layout where the center column will be fluid and take up as much available space as is there, to no avail. Best I could do was set 65% as the width and that does most of what I hoped for, at least for a 1280x1024. The true holy grail is at this site, but would require me building a whole new style to match kind of what I have using this as the base [http://www.glish.com/css/7.asp](http://www.glish.com/css/7.asp) The right column does not flitter away underneath the content as happens with mine when the page is sized smaller. \*sigh\*  
  
Anyhow, take a look at my css for my tweaks at the bottom and I hope this makes things more readable.
