Nice proof of concept code that can read passport data posted to BUGTRAQ. The "key" is comprised of data on the passport itself so you can remotely decrypt someone's data only if you know this information, or can brute-force it since it is a small keyspace:  

>   
> The Passport number  
>   
> The Date Of Birth of the holder  
>   
> The Expiry Date of the Passport  

>   
> The latest version of [RFIDIOt](http://rfidiot.org/), the open-source python library for RFID  
> exploration/manipulation, contains code that implements the ICAO 9303  
> standard for Machine Readable Travel Documents in the form of a test  
> program called 'mrpkey.py'.  
>   
> This program will exchange crypto keys with the passport and read and  
> display the contents therein, including the facial image and the  
> personal data printed in the passport.  

Bruce Schneier advises US passport holders to renew your passport NOW before the RFID requirement goes into effect so you can avoid being tracked or hunted down in our country or a foreign country. Otherwise, how will you still be able to claim you're a Canadian in foreign countries?
