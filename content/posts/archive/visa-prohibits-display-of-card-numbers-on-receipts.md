[\[IP\] I will start using my Visa card more](https://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200303/msg00068.html "[IP] I will start using my Visa card more")  
  
Wow this blog entry is old. But remember when every receipt had the full card number on it? And remember when Starbucks would mask out everything \_except\_ the last four digits so that you could get the full card number with just two receipts?  
  
I still find that the business' copy of the receipts often has the full card number on it, with only my copy being masked out. But, I don't much care, except when it comes to my Debit card receipts since the US laws do not cover Debit cards as fully as credit cards.
