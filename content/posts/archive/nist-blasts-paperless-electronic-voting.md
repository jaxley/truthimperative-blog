The _[National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST)_ recently published a paper condemning paperless electronic voting machines as insecurable.Â  I'll have to read the paper in-depth to see how they came to that strong of a conclusion, but I do know that there is no research showing that a purely electronic system can be completely trustworthy.  
  
It's amazing how far this subject has come in just a few years, yet how far it still needs to go as evidenced by the irregularities in the recent 2006 midterm election.
