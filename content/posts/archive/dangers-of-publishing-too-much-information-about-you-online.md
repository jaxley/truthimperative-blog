I am often surprised at how much information bloggers put about their daily activities online. I myself prefer to publish information about what I've done \_after\_ I get back to avoid blabbing to the world when I will be gone. And, I don't have my calendar publically-available either. Do you? How much do you leak out about yourself online?
