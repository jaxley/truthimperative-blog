An update to this story: As of Sept 2004, a heavily-redacted report was released that reportedly found fault with some of the RCMP's handling of the case, but, according to the CBC timeline, claims that the RCMP did not know that the US was planning to arrest and deport him to Syria.  
  

> "Prime Minister Jean Chrï¿½en tells the House of Commons that the U.S. government's deportation of a Canadian to Syria was "unacceptable," but he is adamant that he will not allow an independent inquiry into the case of Maher Arar. He says his government has asked U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell for an explanation and that the government also wants to find out whether Canadian intelligence officials played a role in the deportation of Arar."
