[The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54660-2003Mar7.html) has a story about the victory for free speech handed down by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday. They upheld a lower court injunction blocking the law (COPA) as being too squishy to withstand constitutional muster.  
  
"Previously, the 3rd Circuit had ruled the law unconstitutional on grounds that it allowed the legality of Internet content to be judged by "contemporary community standards."

**Note: Updated on 3-12-03 to change content to reflect CIPA to COPA. This law acronym alphabet soup is just as bad as telecom's! A CIPA [announcement](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/02/12/0058247&mode=thread&tid=103&tid=153) came out recently but this was supposed to be about COPA...**
