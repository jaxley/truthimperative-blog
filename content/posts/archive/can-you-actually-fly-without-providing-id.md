I am just reading a Lee Child book from 1999 (pre 9/11) where the main character flew under president's names. Would be fun if you could get away with this. Might try it on my next flight...  
  
I almost laughed when I went to the Westin building in Seattle and the guard was going to let me in but I had to show him my ID to get a badge, presumably. But it was funny that someone who worked in the building that I was coming to see happened to come by at the same time and was able to take me in without showing ID or getting a badge. Go figure. So, how important for security \_is\_ showing an ID then? And, if your threat model includes suicide bombers, what does an ID buy you in terms of protection?
