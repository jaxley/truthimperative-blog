This is an excellent guide to the kinds of things that you may or may not be familiar with as possible sources of embarrassment on Facebook, or even just if you want to have more control over people monitoring you.  But you do have control over these things.  I might suggest the relationship one for many people -- so that you only post to your profile relationship status changes that you really want to broadcast.
