I'm definitely not a typical member of the monster truck demographic, and was astounded at the super-fans waiting in huge lines for their autographs, but I am a member of the male demographic and the kind that likes things-that-go-boom, things-that-crush-things, marvels of engineering, and what you can do with 1500 horsepower.  
  
So I recently attended Monster Jam at the Tacoma Dome, which is not just monster trucks but also some crazy jeep barrel races and the demolition + motocross = demo-cross.  Plenty of senseless destruction, rollovers, catching on fire, etc. for my dad's birthday.  It was actually a bit of fun but something you really only need to see perhaps once.  
  
I took some pretty decent photos on my camera:
