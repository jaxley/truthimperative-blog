>   
> But what if the same secret technology, called global positioning satellite tracking, could track anyone at any time?  
>   
> The Washington Supreme Court will decide soon whether police agencies throughout the state may use the device freely -- without a warrant. The Jackson case is the first in the state dealing with the issue.  

  
  
Update: The court [unanimously decided that a warrant is required:](https://www.aclu.org/privacy/spying/14888prs20030911.html)  
  

>   
> OLYMPIA, WA - The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington today hailed a unanimous, first-in-the-nation ruling by the Washington Supreme Court that police must obtain a warrant in order to track an individual's movements with Global Positioning Systems (GPS). The ruling agrees with arguments the ACLU submitted in a friend-of-the-court brief in the case.  
>   
> "The ACLU applauds the court's ruling in this landmark case. Tracking a person's movements by GPS is highly intrusive. It is the equivalent of placing an invisible police officer in the back seat of a person's car," said ACLU of Washington Privacy Project Director Doug Klunder, who wrote the ACLU's brief.
