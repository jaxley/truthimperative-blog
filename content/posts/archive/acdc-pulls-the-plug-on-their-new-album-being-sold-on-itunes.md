Well, after talking with many kids who rarely buy albums, I can see their point.  But eventually they will come to an end.  AC/DC is delaying the inevitable.  
  
[AC/DC refuses to sell album through iTunes | NEWS.com.au](https://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,24493704-5014239,00.html)  

> FOR those about to rock, AC/DC salutes you — unless, that is, you want to buy the heavy metal group's newest album Black Ice on iTunes.  
>   
> "Maybe I'm just being old-fashioned, but this iTunes, God bless 'em, it's going to kill music if they're not careful," said lead singer Brian Johnson, 61.  
>   
> AC/DC, formed by brothers Angus and Malcolm Young in 1973, is among only a handful of bands to refuse to put their music on the popular download service.  
>   
> Johnson said the decision was a bid to protect the album format from the internet's emphasis on buying and selling single tracks.
