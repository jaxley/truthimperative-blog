Gotta love brit humor! This is great tongue-in-cheek commentary at its best.  
  
The background: News.com UK published details about Google's CEO using **public** information found on...Google (aka [Google hacking](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931836361/juxtaposition-20/103-3370624-7611854?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1)). Google wasn't happy about this, so they banned Google employees from speaking to News.com reporters for a year. Absurd!  
  
But, fortunately, ZDNet UK has apologized for the whole matter, although it is covered with loads o' sweet syrupy sarcasm.
