Sign up for the cheap and excellent [2008 ISSA Northwest Regional Security Conference.](https://www.issa-portland.org/regional2008/NWRegional08.htm) It is going to be on April 23rd in the same location, the Olympia Red Lion hotel. You don't have to be an ISSA member to attend -- you just have to pay a tiny bit more. And did I mention there will be a hosted social hour afterward where you can get your mingle &amp; drink on?  
  
There will be an exciting and interesting keynote. Details will be published within the next 24 hours.  
  
This is my 4th year on the conference planning committee, but my 1st year actually participating in the conference itself. I don't know if the website has been updated yet, but I'll be on the panel discussion "Aligning Security with Business Strategy", which should be interesting. The other participants are consultants and one government CIO so there should be some diverse opinions. I'm going to be writing up my thoughts shortly.  
  
I will also be publishing my criteria for how to select the most optimal speakers for a conference in case anyone else is planning to take part in a similar endeavor.  
  
Hope to see you down at the conference!
