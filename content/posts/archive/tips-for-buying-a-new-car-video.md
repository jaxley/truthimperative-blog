This is an entertaining 6 minute video (out of Seattle no less) I documented many of the salient points here.  
  

1.  Plan. Give at least 2 weekends
2.  Get financing \_before\_ you go to your dealership so you know how much you can afford in advance.
3.  Don't sell your car to the dealership. Sell it on craigslist
4.  Get down to top 3 cars you are interested in.
5.  Test drive them. Don't buy it then. Choose all of your options
6.  Don't use the invoice as a guide for price. You want the competitive bid. Call 8-10 dealerships.
7.  Get the "drive it off the lot" price
8.  Come back a second time. Stick to your guns. Walk out when the deal changes.
9.  Don't sign until you are done with everything and all is in writing.
10.  Don't buy any of the add-on stuff (high-margin stuff). Akin to stocking up on candy "at the movie theater" to bring home.
