[Talking Points Memo: by Joshua Micah Marshall](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/ "Talking Points Memo: by Joshua Micah Marshall")  
  
"The DPS \[Department of Public Safety\] appears to have violated Texas state law by destroying the records. To justify this, they point to a federal regulation which a legal expert says is plainly inapplicable. And the very regulation they're trying to hang their hat on seems to bar the original conduct itself."  
  
This whole story is unbelievable. I'm still waiting for what assistance they requested and perhaps received from the department of Homeland Security... There is a possible [criminal investigation](https://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/topstory/1921044) ensuing.
