Keep this handy for the next MS Worm. Posted to [RISKS 22.53:](https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/22.53.html#subj7) .  
\[From Pete Lindstrom, Spire Security, petelind@spiresecurity.com\]  
  
\*<adjective> Computer Worm <verb> Internet\*  
  
In the wee hours of <date>, a <adjective> computer worm spread <adverb>  
throughout the Internet. Dubbed <silly name> because <ridiculous reason  
that doesn't explain anything about how it works>, and also known as  
<another random name> and <another random name>, the worm has infected  
an estimated <number> systems within <length of time>. Experts are  
calling this worm the most <adjective> since <date in the past>.  
  
The worm exploits a hole in <Microsoft product name> that was first  
identified <number> months ago by <security company name>...  
  
In an attempt to secure the planet, <same company> released detailed information about  
the vulnerability and how to exploit it. They also mentioned how to fix  
it, but apparently <noun> listened. Coincidentally, the worm that  
exploited this hole was also first identified by <same company>. Even  
more coincidentally, they make a product to protect against <noun>.  
"Actually, it's not really a <noun>, it's a <noun>," said <Pete  
Lindstrom, or some other person seeking publicity>. " A true <noun>  
works by <random filler that nobody will read>."  
The worm's payload <verb> every system by <verb ending in -ing> the  
<noun>. Comparatively speaking, this is much worse than <another worm>  
but not as bad as <another worm>. The computers of <place> were hit the  
hardest. Current damage is estimated at <dollar figure more than the GNP  
of two-thirds of the world's nations>. " This worm has the potential to  
<something or other>," said <Pete Lindstrom, or some other person trying  
hard to come up with something interesting to say ;-)>. " It just goes  
to show you that <another something or other>."  
Though there is no way to protect against this particular bug, experts  
recommend trying <longshot one> or <longshot two>, neither of which  
matter, since nobody will do it anyway.
