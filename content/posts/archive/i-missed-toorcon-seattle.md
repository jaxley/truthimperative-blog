'Twas May 11-13th.  I need to keep up on my security blogs and news more...  I'll be looking for it next year though.  
  
Speaking of Seattle security groups, I need to find out what's up with [SeaSec.](https://www.dec.net/seasec/)  Seems to have gone stagnant.  I've emailed and not gotten responses.  I organize a periodic get together of security folks from my company; perhaps I should expand it to outside entities?  It serves much the same purpose, although more laser-focused for my employer.
