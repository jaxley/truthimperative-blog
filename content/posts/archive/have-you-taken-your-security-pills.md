The other day, I made what I think is a very apt analogy comparing the security product industry to the diet and herbal supplement industry.  
  

  
*   Both operate with little to no oversight or regulation (though security at least has bloggers and scientists willing to call out some of the more egregious offenders)  
    
*   Products often have little to no academic, scientific or factual basis for their designs or claims  
    
*   Products tend toward the panacea/"silver bullet" realm and claim to solve all your ills  
    

  
  
I'm sure that I am missing some more...
