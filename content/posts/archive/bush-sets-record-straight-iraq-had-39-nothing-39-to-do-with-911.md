[Think Progress: Bush Now Says What He Wouldn’t Say Before War: Iraq Had ‘Nothing’ To Do With 9/11](https://thinkprogress.org/2006/08/21/bush-on-911/ "Think Progress:  Bush Now Says What He Wouldn’t Say Before War: Iraq Had ‘Nothing’ To Do With 9/11")  
  
I saw this first on The Daily Show. I can't believe this hasn't gotten more press despite the large percentage of the country who have been made to accept the opposite as true because of the lapdog press and liars in this administration.
