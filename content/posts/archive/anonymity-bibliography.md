If you are interested in research into the field of anonymity, check this site out.  
  
The "goal is to set up something we can point at for people new to the field \[anonymity\] (and most of us are still new to the field, it seems), so they know which papers to look at to get up to speed. The ones I particularly recommend have boxes around them."
