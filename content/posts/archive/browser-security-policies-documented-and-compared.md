I have often wondered about this kind of thing.  Browsers implement all kinds of "policies" that are largely implemented as undocumented logic in code -- probably in response to a security bug.  Never before that I'm aware of has such a great documentation of considerations for client-side security for browsers been documented.  
  
I've read through the whole thing and it is fascinating reading.  I hope the browser vendors look at this and start a war for who's going to have a more secure browser!

Insufficient understanding of these often poorly-documented characteristics is a major contributing factor to the prevalence of several classes of security vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, vendors routinely introduce proprietary tweaks or improvements that may interfere with existing features in non-obvious ways, and seldom provide a detailed discussion of potential problems.
