[World's Largest Egg, Winlock, Washington](http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/WAWINegg.html "World's Largest Egg, Winlock, Washington")  
  
I didn't even know there was a "Winlock" in Washington, let alone that they were world-renowned!  
  
I feel deceived though because it's not even a real egg.
