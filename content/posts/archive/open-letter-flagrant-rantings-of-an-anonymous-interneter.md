I had to turn this into an open letter response. I saw several of these messages being posted to blogs without any response. Most likely because it is so inflammatory and haphazard.  
  
But, it was so tiring that I had to stop part way though. Maybe someone else can post other replies to finish this out...if you can make it that far.

"We're not sure"? Who is "we". There are a ton  
of people who are passionately in support of Barack Obama and I have  
seen this first-hand at precinct Caucuses. And there is a similar  
fervor among the Hillary supporters.

So? This type of paragraph in chain emails is one that tries to trick  
you into thinking the person is non-partisan when you can tell right  
from the tone of the discussion and the lack of facts that this author  
is _**highly partisan**_. Don't fall for this trick.

Again, so? Are you implying that somehow McCain is not subject to  
these same influences when the dems are?

As if being "liberal" is a bad thing. But, contrary to popular  
propaganda, Obama is not the most liberal senator. By the most  
objective measure around, he has several colleagues more "liberal" than  
he is. Again, not that there is, or should be, anything wrong with  
that. See voteview: [https://voteview.com/](https://voteview.com/)

So, you are implying without saying or providing any EVIDENCE that  
Obama is "corrupt"? Hogwash. In fact, Obama has a higher ranking than  
Clinton on transparency and ethics:

Does anyone think this makes any sense at all? Does anyone actually  
think this is a coherent, logical thought progression? I'm beginning  
to think this whole thing is a long string of non-sequiturs (not  
surprisingly)

Where did this come from? Not even a shred of rationale? "If we had a black president, it should be Colin Powell, not Barack"

So what? There is no point here. Barack never said he "never heard the sermons".

In the words of a good friend of mine, this is "horseshit". The author  
is trying to say that Obama went \_with Wright\_ to visit Farrakhan?  
There is no evidence of that. In fact, Wright went with Farrakhan to  
visit Kadafy. This author doesn't even have facts, let alone have them  
in the right order.

I defy you to find a quote of this. The press has referred to him in this way, but Obama has denied this:  
  
"He was never my "spiritual mentor." He was -- he was my pastor. And so  
to some extent, how, you know, the -- the press characterized in the  
past that relationship, I think, wasn't accurate."

Okay, let me guess. You're not voting for Obama but you're not going  
to tell us why. You're just going to continue with more non-sequiturs.

Oh, it is the congregation! Seriously?! Guilt by association? Surely  
Wright has said some strange things but lots of what he has said rings  
true. I bet this guy hasn't heard more than a soundbite though.  
  
But what about the kinds of hateful, judgemental, crazy things that white pastors are saying, such as Hagee,  
  
"I believe that New Orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to  
God, and they were recipients of the judgment of God for that."  
"military confrontation with Iran is foretold in the Bible as a necessary precondition for the Second Coming."  
  
"Hagee, pastor of  
the 16,000-member Cornerstone Church, last week had announced a "slave  
sale" to raise funds for high school seniors in his church bulletin,  
"The Cluster." The item was introduced with the  
sentence "Slavery in America  
is returning to Cornerstone" and ended with "Make plans to come and  
go home with a slave.""  
  
  
"Do you know the  
difference between a woman with PMS and a snarling Doberman pinscher? The  
answer is _lipstick_. Do you know  
the difference between a terrorist and a woman with PMS? You can negotiate with  
a terrorist."  
  
He is even alleged to have made some very anti-Catholic statements,  
although I have yet to see an original in-context quote of Hagee making  
these statements. I don't believe Bill Donohoe as a credible quoter,  
since I think he's afraid of being out-crazied (Donohoe said,  
""Hollywood is controlled by secular [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew "Jew") who hate [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") in general and [Catholicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism "Catholicism") in particular. It's not a secret, OK? And I'm not afraid to say it")  
  
Oh, and yet this anonymous author is fine with McCain who said, ""all I can tell you is that I am very proud to have Pastor John Hagee's support." Hypocrite!  

> > **_****Even Oprah Winfrey got****_**  
> > 
> > **_****disgusted and walked out. I am no Oprah fan,****

I could not find anything about Oprah getting "disgusted" and  
"walk\[ing\] out". She did leave the church due to Wright eventually.

Just because he heard it, doesn't mean he believes it. And I don't see  
any particular quotes you think we should be outraged about. Again, I  
don't think you've heard/read more than soundbites.

But, you'll believe all the stupid crap peddled by McCain? Really?

You haven't shown any reason why. Just ranted...

OMFG! This guy is pulling out all the stops! This is such a load of  
propagandic BS that has been totally debunked. Obama is a model of the  
American dream, building himself up from adversity. The author here is  
an idiot.

What? Does that make sense to anyone?

Oh, so now she's a feminist (in quotes, whatever that means)? Any  
empowered woman is a feminist? What evidence/rationale? Oh yeah,  
there isn't any provided. Moving along...

What is this guy talking about? I'm no big Hillary fan but this is just stupid.

You might have something there about her not being forthright, although  
bringing in the "waterboarding" aka "water torture" is a nice  
right-wing touch, don't you think?  

> > **_****Still you play the role****_**  
> > 
> > **_****of the "embarrassed but dignified noble****

Why all the quotes? What are you trying to say with this statement?  

> > **_****What utter malarky !****_**

On what basis? Oh yeah, he doesn't need to give one.  

> > **_****I am  
> > not voting for you for a world of reasons,****  
> >   
> > ****but the main one is the same as

You still have not made a coherent argument describing what this position is and further, how McCain does not.  

> > **_****You****

> > ****persistently insult my

Well, judging by this insane rant, it should be insulted.

What is the broken record? Bill Clinton? So, your point is that her  
husband was a bastard and you are going to presume that you know what  
she did/did not know (there is no evidence provided where she claims to  
not have known nor that she has "ask\[ed\] \[you\] to believe" this).  
Plus, I don't believe that Paula Jones was proven.  

> > **_****But let's set aside your  
> > hubby's flagrant pecadillos.****_**

Yes, let's not impugn her by criticizing someone who is not her, Bill Clinton. Moving along...  

> > **_****The real****

There wasn't any there-there with those "scandals". Who do you think  
was responsible for the flood of false accusations? And, again,  
nothing about Hillary specifically mentioned. Don't you find that odd?

I guess the author couldn't "keep \[it\] in his pants" long enough to  
avoid going back to impugning Hillary by criticizing Bill. Not even a  
whole paragraph could he wait!

Enough with the Bill talk. What about Hillary!?

OMFG! I'll refer you to the PDB that Bush and company IGNORED  
entitled, "Bin Laden Determined To Strike in US". BUSH did NOTHING  
about Bin Laden or Al Quaeda. Clinton, and Richard Clarke, were doing  
something about it. See anything about what Richard Clarke has said.

There is some truth to the first part, but the last part is just ad-hominem. Where is the evidence?

When did she do this? I find no evidence of this. I can't take anymore of this. Over &amp; out.
