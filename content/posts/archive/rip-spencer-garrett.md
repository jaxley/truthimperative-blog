This was shocking news in a year that is shaping up to be at least as bizarre as last year for me.  
  
Spencer was one of the smartest people I have ever met, one of the best UNIX/network/tech/IT administrator gurus anywhere and a great friend to all. You will be missed.  
  
His ISP business [2alpha](http://www.2alpha.com) will hopefully continue on with his business partners still at the helm.
