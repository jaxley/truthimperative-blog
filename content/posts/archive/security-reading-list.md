A book that I am reading right now:  
  
[Between Silk and Cyanide](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/068486780X/juxtaposition-20/002-9232737-7119204) A true story of cryptography in the field during WWII.  
  
A free 900 page eBook from Microsoft Press: [Improving Web Application Security: Threats and Countermeasures](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnnetsec/html/ThreatCounter.asp)  
  
You may want to just [buy a paper copy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735618429/juxtaposition-20/002-9232737-7119204?dev-t=DW7KZDVJYZAIL%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2) since it weighs in at 3-4 inches of paper (I have a copy of the "real" book and it's big).  
  
Another book that sounds interesting:  
  
[Secrets of Computer Espionage: Tactics and Countermeasures](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764537105/juxtaposition-20/002-9232737-7119204?dev-t=DW7KZDVJYZAIL%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2) "Covers electronic and wireless eavesdropping, computer surveillance,  
intelligence gathering, password cracking, keylogging, data duplication, black bag computer spy jobs, reconnaissance, risk assessment, legal issues, and advanced spying techniques used by the government.  
  
Author shares easily-implemented countermeasures against spying to  
detect and defeat eavesdroppers and other hostile individuals.
