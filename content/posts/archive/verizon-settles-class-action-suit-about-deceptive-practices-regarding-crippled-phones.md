This is great news.  They did the same with other phones, including the e815 that I have.  Fortunately, there are ways around this to re-enable the crippled features, but they are out of reach to most consumers.  I had to buy a data cable and software on eBay to uncripple my phone.  
  
[\[infowarrior\] - Verizon Slapped for Crippling Bluetooth](http://www.mail-archive.com/infowarrior@g2-forward.org/msg01978.html)  

> Verizon has been getting weasely with some of its customers in California who bought its Motorola v710 Bluetooth-³capable² phone on or before January 31, 2005. Preliminary approval of the settlement was granted in a California court for a class-action suit against the company because it didn¹t accurately tell prospective customers that its Bluetooth features weren¹t what they appeared to be. Verizon said the phone ³works with a PC² but left out that part about how you can¹t wirelessly sync photos or contacts or any other files using Bluetooth.
