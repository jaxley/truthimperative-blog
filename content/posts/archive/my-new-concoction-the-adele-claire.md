You loved her as a baby...Now, from the makers of the Adele Claire baby, comes a refreshing summer drink.  
  
Our master mixologist (me) has been hard at work devising a drink worthy of the name Adele Claire and now it has arrived!  

*   2 oz Gin (preferably an aromatic such as Tangueray 10 or Bombay Sapphire)
*   2 oz Pineapple juice
*   1/2 oz fresh lemon juice
*   1/2 oz simple syrup
*   3 fresh sage leaves

Combine all in a cocktail shaker with plenty of ice.Â  Strain into a martini glass and be sure to grab the sage (floats to the top of the shaker) for garnish and extra flavor in each glass.
