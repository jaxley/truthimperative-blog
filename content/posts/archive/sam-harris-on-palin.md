This is one of my favorite parts of this article for Newsweek.  The scary thing is that you could see her answering a question just like this.  
  
[Sam Harris on Sarah Palin and Elitism | Newsweek Politics: Campaign 2008 | Newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/id/160080/page/3)  

> What is so unnerving about the candidacy of Sarah Palin is the degree to which she represents—and her supporters celebrate—the joyful marriage of confidence and ignorance. Watching her deny to Gibson that she had ever harbored the slightest doubt about her readiness to take command of the world's only superpower, one got the feeling that Palin would gladly assume any responsibility on earth:  
>   
> "Governor Palin, are you ready at this moment to perform surgery on this child's brain?"  
>   
> "Of course, Charlie. I have several boys of my own, and I'm an avid hunter."  
>   
> "But governor, this is neurosurgery, and you have no training as a surgeon of any kind."  
>   
> "That's just the point, Charlie. The American people want change in how we make medical decisions in this country. And when faced with a challenge, you cannot blink."
