A gaggle of links about the illegal NSA domestic spying program. More apropos in light of even more [spying by the Bush Administration](http://www.aclu.org/safefree/spying/25984prs20060623.html) -- this time on [international wire transfers](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/06/25/search_of_banking_records_raises_privacy_concerns/)

And some analysis of how this kind of program is ineffective (My favorite description is that finding a needle in a haystack is not made easier by increasing the size of the haystack)
