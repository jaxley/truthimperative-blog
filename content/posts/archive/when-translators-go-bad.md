I laughed so hard at these mistranslations found on menus in China.  
  
One of my favorites:  
  
"Benumbed hot vegetables fries fuck silk"  
  
Read the comments for a good explanation of how this malicious literal translation gives rise to such humorous groupings of words. I guess you may be able to place an order even with these being so muddled, but I'd stay away from the "sour and sweet bone" and "cowboy meat". But I hear the "Assorted Fuck" is a real delicacy!
