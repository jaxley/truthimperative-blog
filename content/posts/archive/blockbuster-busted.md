[BLOCKBUSTER SETTLES INVESTIGATION INTO ADVERTISING FOR "NO LATE FEE" PROGRAM](https://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2005/mar/mar29b_05.html "BLOCKBUSTER SETTLES INVESTIGATION INTO ADVERTISING FOR ")  
  
For the most part, this is a good thing. It was addressed fairly quickly for one. I'm not sure that, aside from the negative publicity, that this is going to dissuade them from continuing with other deceptive practices because, according to the agreement, they do not have to do anything other than:  
  
"Blockbuster also agreed to provide a full refund or credit to any customer who failed to return the item within the thirty day period, but who now returns it in good condition by April 28, 2005.  
  
If the customer already has returned the item but has paid a "restocking" fee, the customer can obtain a refund of the "restocking" fee. A request for restitution must be made in writing and allege a failure to understand the "No Late Fee" program."  
  
So, "oops", they just have to refund the deceptive charges and don't have to provide any kind of other restitution.
