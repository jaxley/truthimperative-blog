Several recent editions of RISKS discuss some evidence of the dangers of IRV (Instant Runoff Voting) systems. Which is a shame since I hoped that they would offer a better approach that could help break the stranglehold of the two-party system.  When they discuss paradoxical results, one is the situation such as if three people vote and the votes are:  
  
A preferred over B  
B preferred over C  
C preferred over A  
  
What is the solution to this that will result in the "right" person being elected?  There are other paradoxes as well that can occur when people leave the race before it is decided too.  
  
Well, I at least wanted to be able to have a "negative vote" where I could specify a lack of desire for a candidate.  There may still be hope.
