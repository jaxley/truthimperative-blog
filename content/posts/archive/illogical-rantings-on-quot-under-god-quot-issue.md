I couldn't pass this one up.  
  
[Miami News-Record - Gerald Stone Column](https://www.miaminewsrecord.com/MIAMINEWSRECORD/sites/MIAMINEWSRECORD/0747edition/myarticles806650.asp?P=806650&S=320&PubID=13381 "Miami News-Record - Gerald Stone Column")

I'll add some clarification to this statement:  
  
"we" = you and those who believe as you do  
"our lives" = the lives of you and those who believe as you do.  
  
It was a bit unclear. It sounded like you are representing non-Judeo-Christians.  
  
And more God in your life requires "under God" in the national pledge of allegiance? Does not follow...

I can hardly begin to respond to this fallaciousness. Now I really know that you never read the court decision text.  
  

>   
> "the Supreme Court will probably hear the case sometime this year and you can expect �under God� to be taken out of the pledge.  
> ...  
>   
> The Bush administration, in its petition to the high court, argues that the Pledge is not like a prayer or invocation. They're the only ones making sense. But, the atheist-inclined liberals will probably get their way."

  
  
So, anyone who agrees with the court's decision, for whatever reason, is painted as "atheist-inclined" and a "liberal". That is such an enlightened viewpoint.  
  
And why is it that many Republicans want the government to be involved in actively furthering a particular faith but in most other aspects of life (e.g. gun control) they want to be left alone?
