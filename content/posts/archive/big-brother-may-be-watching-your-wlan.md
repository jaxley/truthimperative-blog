Also a [slashdot discussion](https://hardware.slashdot.org/hardware/05/04/05/1428250.shtml?tid=193&tid=172<br />) of this technique, which essentially cracks WEP implementations that are vulnerable to weak keys and uses some nice "features" of some APs to get the AP to send out additional encrypted packets to improve the speed of the attack. They can crack WEP in minutes. Pretty interesting...
