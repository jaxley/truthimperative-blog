Both sound pretty cool.  I'll add to my RSS reader and look out for any new and unique sites.

> Welcome! My name is Mark Frauenfelder, and this is my new blog about a book I wrote called Rule the Web: How To Do Anything and Everything on the Internet -- Better, Faster, Easier. It's be a guide to cool ways to use the Internet to make your life better. It’s not a comprehensive list of every website out there — instead, it shows you how to enhance different areas of your life — your creativity, work, education, travel, health, leisure, and so on.
