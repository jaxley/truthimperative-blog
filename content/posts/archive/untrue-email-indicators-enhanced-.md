I found myself writing an enhanced follow-up to a [previous blog posting](http://www.blogger.com/2009/02/untrue-email-in.html) on the indicators that correlate to the likely falsehood of a chain email.Â  In my experience on the Internet, there are many factors which \__**negatively correlate**_\_ to the truthfulness of a chain email message (meaning, the presence of one or more of these factors only increases the probability that the content is bunk). I could likely write a program to analyze emails for these factors and identify about 100% of chain emails:  

*   Font size > 12 point (less true the larger the font size)
*   Forwarded so many times the original email is 4 or more levels below the most recent email
*   The message forwarded to a number of recipients without the forwarder adding anything substantive as commentary (ratio of forwarded text to added text very high)
*   Ratio of exclamation points to periods.
*   Multiple colored text in the original email
*   Number of recipients in the forwarded email
*   Any urging in the email to 'keep this going' or 'pass this along to everyone you can'
*   Links to snopes in the original email (often not even to the right topic) or an assertion in the original email that it was 'checked on snopes'
