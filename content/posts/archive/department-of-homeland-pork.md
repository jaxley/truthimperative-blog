Get this:  The list of top terrorist targets from the Department of Homeland Security is seriously braindead.  It includes 1,305 casinos, 234 restaurants, an ice cream parlor, a tackle shop, a flea market, and an Amish popcorn factory  3,650 sites total.  What's going on?  Pork-barrel politics is what's going on.  We're never going to get security right if we continue to make it a parody of itself.  
  
The worst part is that DHS didn't even try to hide the pork-barreling by making the inclusions and omissions clear and blatant.  Oy.  I reluctantly file this in the security category...

I've critiqued everything from the waste of buying anti-terrorist locks for Sammamish City Hall to the illogic of not having security cameras outside our airport. And yes, I've resorted to that columnist stock-in-trade: mocking and satirizing.
