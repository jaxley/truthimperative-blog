The "they" is the Democrats.  We know we can't count on the Republican wankers to do the right thing, only what's right for their base.  But can we count on the Democrats?  So far, it doesn't look good.  
  
I'd be down for an independent ticket for 2008, so long as it doesn't put another Republican in the white house like Nader helped with last time.  However, it is looking like the Dems have a good set of candidates to choose from thus far.  But who of them can \_lead\_?  We'll see.
