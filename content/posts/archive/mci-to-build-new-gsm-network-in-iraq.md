MCI gets $500 million to build a new GSM network in Iraq. There are a couple of interesting aspects to this:  
  
a. The sensible GSM network was chosen amid staunch lobbying by Qualcomm junkies to build an "American" CDMA network. Hooray!  
  
b. MCI is not a wireless telephone company. Why are they getting to build a wireless network from scratch instead of other wireless carriers? They were actually a reseller of AT&T Wireless before their accounting scandals.
