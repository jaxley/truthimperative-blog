I think that right now it is sleeting in Seattle.  

*   Freezing Rain:  supercooled raindrops that freeze instantly when they hit the ground or other objects
*   Hail:  snow and rain in the upper atmosphere mix due to updrafts and accumulate into large pellets that fall to earth when the updraft can't support their weight
*   Sleet:  Partially-melted snow that freezes again on the way down and falls as visible pellets.
