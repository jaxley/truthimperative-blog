A post to the IP and Risks lists is a harbinger of things to come as more and more complexity and computer-controlled systems get added to everyday devices without ensuring the same kind of quality and safety engineering. We can only hope that Ford and other car companies will not be successful in overturning laws requiring mechanical connections for safety-critical systems like steering, braking, etc.

Crashed Computer Traps Thai Politician, 14 May 2003  
[https://aardvark.co.nz/daily/2003/n051301.shtml](https://aardvark.co.nz/daily/2003/n051301.shtml)  
  
Thailand's Finance Minister Suchart Jaovisidha had to be rescued today  
from  
inside his expensive BMW limousine after the onboard computer crashed,  
leaving the vehicle immobilized.  
  
Once the computer failed, neither the door locks, power windows nor air  
conditioning systems would function, leaving the Minister and his driver  
trapped inside the rapidly heating vehicle.  
  
Despite the pair's best efforts, it took a full ten minutes before they  
were  
able to summon the attention of a nearby guard who freed the two men by  
smashing one of the vehicle's windows with a sledgehammer.  
  
A report ([https://www.bangkokpost.com/Business/13May2003\_biz12.html](https://www.bangkokpost.com/Business/13May2003_biz12.html))  
published in the \*Bangkok Post\* indicates that the vehicle was Mr  
Jaovisidha's own BMW 520 which was being used while his state-supplied  
Mercedes, was being repaired.  
  
BMW's more up-market 7-series range uses a computer system called  
i-drive  
which has Microsoft's WindowsCE at its core.

Did Mr Jaovisidha narrowly miss being killed by the blue windscreen of  
death?
