A pretty good list to keep in mind for securing your house.  
  
I would also avoid keeping curtains open with a direct view into what kind of expensive stuff you have waiting inside. I've seen many a house these days with nice LCD or plasma TVs in the living room visible from the front door...  
  
One of the best home security tips is to get to know your neighbors so you can watch out for each other.
