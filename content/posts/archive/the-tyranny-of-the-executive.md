> My concern is that the Bush Administration may be spying only on suspected terrorists **the way that it invades only countries supporting those who attacked the United States on 9/11**. My concern is with the possibility that Bush Administration officials might have an agenda, with an ulterior motive, that would involve invading a country so they rationalize a way of thinking about this country that makes it seem to them to be worthy of attack.  

  
  
Emphasis added. This is a perfect description of why these programs are so troubling. The whole article, in fact, is a look through a crystal ball of where this country is heading if we allow unfettered power in the hands of the Executive branch.  
  
The American democratic "experiment" needs some adjustment to rebalance power. Congress as watchdog is more like a lapdog. They don't wield their power over the purse strings: they hand out blank checks and don't oversee what we are getting for that money.
