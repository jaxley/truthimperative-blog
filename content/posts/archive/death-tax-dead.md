[U.S. Senate blocks permanent estate tax repeal|Reuters.com](http://today.reuters.com/investing/financeArticle.aspx?type=bondsNews&storyID=2006-06-08T152117Z_01_WAT005774_RTRIDST_0_CONGRESS-TAX-VOTE-URGENT.XML "U.S. Senate blocks permanent estate tax repealReuters.com")  
  
This was a stunning setback: 57-41 against. Awesome. I'm not happy about the additional tax cuts but at least our federal coffers won't be further depleted and the super-super rich won't get another out, causing the lower classes to pick up the tax burden.
