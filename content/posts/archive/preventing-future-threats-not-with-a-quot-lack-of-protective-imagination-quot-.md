And, after hurricane Katrina, I would add that on top of a "lack of protective imagination", government continues to suffer as well from "pork barrel security projects" and "[visible-but-ineffective security projects](https://www.virginiadot.org/infoservice/news/newsrelease.asp?ID=HRO-04-24)" that [divert precious resources away](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/10/terrorists_play.html) from the real or more likely threats.  
  
An unfortunate example of this is how "The federal government will pay the overtime of cops and emergency medical workers if the drill involves an act of terrorism, but it won't if locals rehearse for a natural disaster." So, the government is still making it difficult for localities, such as Seattle, to prepare for \_likely threats\_ and instead they have to fake it by running drills for the more unlikely terrorism-related scenarios instead. See [Is Seattle Really Ready?](https://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/consumernews/2002502756_disaster18m.html)  
  
The other glaringly-apparent issue is that unqualified people are being put into positions of authority of governmental agencies that are in charge of protection and response for natural disasters and other events. I have lost my belief that government can be a reliable first line of assistance and that individual citizens and localities have to take matters into their own hands to be prepared, just like you would do for a retirement plan. Don't rely on social security, welfare, or unemployment as your sole safety net and now add to that governmental response to disasters.  
  
I'm going to be reactivating my local neighborhood disaster preparedness facility since I can't believe that if there was any kind of significant event that there could be a reasonable expectation of a decent national response.
