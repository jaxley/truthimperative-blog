Um, yeah. [Godwin's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law) in full effect. Disgraceful!  
  
['Gas the jews' vs. 'Marry the gays': 'SaveCalifornia' get cold feet - Good As You:: Gay and Lesbian Activism With a Sense of](https://www.goodasyou.org/good_as_you/2008/05/gas-the-jews-vs.html) [Humor](https://www.goodasyou.org/good_as_you/2008/05/gas-the-jews-vs.html)  
  
But it is also good to see New York State move to recognize same-sex marriages as well.  
  
How can people compartmentalize so that they don't see how "Separate but Equal" is the same argument as "Civil unions but not "marriage""? "Separate but equal is a set phrase denoting the system of [segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation "Racial segregation")  
that justifies giving different groups of people separate facilities or  
services with the declaration that the quality of each group's public  
facilities remain equal." Hello? If that is illegal and immoral, then why not these laws? It's the same thing and I predict eventually they will either be repealed or ruled unconstitutional. In fact, it violates the [Fourteenth Amendment (Equal Protection Clause)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause)
