New Washington State Quarter designs. I think that we should use the state quarter designs to vote states out of the union. I'd say that if you put your best on a quarter and all you can come up with is lame crap like "Birthplace of Aviation Pioneers" (as if one resident's coincidental occupancy in your state somehow is noteworthy) then perhaps we don't need you in the union. That said, Washington's proposals are pretty tame. I do like Salmon, the mountains, and apples. Although we are one of the up-and-coming wine regions so perhaps they should pick that instead?

Now this is a cool looking device. I would like to do something like this in my house to join network + audio sources. I think that a box running MythTV would be cheaper and better though:
