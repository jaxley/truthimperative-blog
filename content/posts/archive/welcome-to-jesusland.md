Interesting talk on The McLaughlin Group this week about the division between the "Jesusland" parts of the country (who mostly receive more Federal $$ than they pay in, BTW) and the other "non-Jesusland" states that could give rise to a revolt over the next four years, especially if fundamentalist judge appointments appear during this second term.
