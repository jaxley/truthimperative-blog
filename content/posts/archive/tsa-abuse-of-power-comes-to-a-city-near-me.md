This story from my hometown of Seattle is further proof that the current airport security procedures are nothing more than window dressing and are leading to the loss of civil rights for innocent people.  
  
When was the last time you heard about these security procedures actually catching a terrorist?  
  
[komo news | 'This Is Not Right'](https://www.komotv.com/stories/37150.htm "komo news | 'This Is Not Right'")  
  

>   
> DES MOINES - Cecilia Beaman is a 57-year-old grandmother, a principal at Pacific Middle School in Des Moines, and as of Sunday is also a suspected terrorist.  
>   
> "This is not right," she told us. It's not right!"  

  
  

>   
> During the stay she made sandwiches for the kids and was careful to pack the knives she used to prepare those sandwiches in her checked luggage. She says she even alerted security screeners that the knives were in her checked bags and they told her that was OK.  
>   
> But Beaman says she couldn't find a third knife. It was a 5 1/2 inch bread knife with a rounded tip and a serrated edge. She thought she might have lost or misplaced it during the trip.  
>   
> On the trip home, screeners with the Transportation Security Administration at Los Angeles International Airport found it deep in the outside pocket of a carry-on cooler. Beaman apologized and told them it was a mistake.  
>   
> "You've committed a felony," Beaman says a security screener announced. "And you're considered a terrorist."  
>   
> Beaman says she was told her name would go on a terrorist watch-list and that she would have to pay a $500 fine.  

  
  
And to make it worse, you are guilty without the ability to confront your accuser and clear your name

> She says screeners refused to give her paperwork or documentation of her violation, documentation of the pending fine, or a copy of the photograph of the knife.
