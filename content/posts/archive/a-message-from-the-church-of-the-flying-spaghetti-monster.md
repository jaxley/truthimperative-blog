[OPEN LETTER TO KANSAS SCHOOL BOARD](https://www.venganza.org/ "Open Letter")  
  
My new greeting will have to be: "May you be forever touched by His Noodly Appendage"  
  
Since a judge in washington [today just ruled](https://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/aplocal_story.asp?category=6420&slug=WA%20Everett%20Ten%20Commandments) that it is okay to post the 10 commandments on government property in some cases without posing a "threat to the religious freedoms of the citizens", this would be a great time to get some of the Flying Spaghetti Monster commandments on public land. Fair is fair, right?  
  
One of my new favorite words is [Pastafarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastafarian)
