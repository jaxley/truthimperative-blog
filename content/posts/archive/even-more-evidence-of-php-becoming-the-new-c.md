Another example of how PHP can be dangerous. Having to know the internal workings of variable acceptance to implement secure data checking seems to negate the value of having a higher-order programming language.  
  
And, it is common in other languages to work with variables in a REQUEST structure of some sort.  
  
PHP should provide a built-in set of semantics for data input filtering that work across all of the possible input types so that each application doesn't have to build their own. I even remember when you used to have to build your own PHP session management or use additional PHP modules (PHPlib was a great implementation) before it got rolled into PHP 4.
