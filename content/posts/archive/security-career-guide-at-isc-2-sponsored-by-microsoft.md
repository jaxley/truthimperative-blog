> A nonprofit organization with help from Microsoft has created a "career  
> guide" to spark interest for the information security profession among high  
> school and college students.  
>   
> The guide was distributed last month to more than 3,500 school counselors,  
> administrators and educators at education conferences and has been made  
> available online, the International Information Systems Security  
> Certification Consortium, or (ISC)2, said this week.  
>   
> Microsoft sponsored the 35-page guide, which is titled "Decoding the  
> Information Security Profession." The booklet offers a description of  
> information security, typical jobs, titles, industries and organizations,  
> professional requirements, certification options, typical salaries, career  
> outlook, and a listing of schools, education facilities, certification  
> companies and other resources and associations.
