I got some seriously choice spam messages this week. Here are some of the outstanding ones. The first one was hilarious -- but even more hilarious that it decided to include the TV show "The View" in the list of the "earth's ills" for a double punch line.  
  

> Former Astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell - a veteran of the Apollo 14 mission - claims aliens are gay and that they are responsible for many of the earth's ills including global warming, war, disease and The View.  
>   
> The House of Representatives ethics committee has passed a new set of Republican backed rules which reduce the Ten Commandments down to nine "suggestions".

> Paris Hilton Gives Birth To Twins...Aliens

> Paris Hilton Becomes Mormon -- Marries Paparazzi
