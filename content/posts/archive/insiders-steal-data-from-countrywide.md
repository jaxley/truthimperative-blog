I got my letter this week that my data appeared to be affected.  They are taking serious measures though and offered 2 years of free credit monitoring services to those affected.  
  
Although I can't help but think about how phishy it looks when I was directed to go to not experian.com, but consumerinfo.com/countrywide.  And I'm supposed to know that consumerinfo.com is Experian??
