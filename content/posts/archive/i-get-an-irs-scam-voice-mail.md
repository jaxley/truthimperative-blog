Had to share this hilarious voice-mail I received from an IRS scammer (happened to come in with Unknown caller ID -- I read online that others had been spoofing US phone numbers for caller ID in the past). The transcript does not do it justice.  I laughed out loud when I heard the phrase, "and you get arrested" as that is precisely what one would expect to hear from the IRS.  
  
  
They actually tried calling me back and I got to talk to one of the people that afternoon, but my crummy cell service in my office resulted in the call dropping before I could chat with them too much. I told them that I didn't believe them that they were from the IRS. Maybe they'll call back again this week?  
  
I plan on reporting it, as suggested.  Head over to the IRS [Tax Fraud Alerts](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Tax-Fraud-Alerts) page.  Perhaps the best channel will be via their [Phishing](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Report-Phishing) page.  The [IRS warning](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Warns-of-Pervasive-Telephone-Scam) regarding this scam provides some information but there is of course no direct links to report the issue.  I wonder if the 20,000 that reported it are a small fraction of those victimized since it's so difficult to find a way to report it?  They also suggest lodging a complaint with the FTC as well, but that is also somewhat difficult to determine how to categorize it for reporting.
