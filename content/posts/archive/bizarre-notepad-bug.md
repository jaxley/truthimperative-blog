[27B Stroke 6](https://blog.wired.com/27BStroke6/index.blog?entry_id=1502576 "27B Stroke 6")  
  
Bizarre notepad bug that really exists. If you type a phrase consisting of a 4 letter word, then two three letter words, then a 5 letter word, save it, then reopen it, the text will be corrupted and unreadable. There is a claim that not all words cause this to occur. See the linked story for examples of what does work.  
  
There was a great quote:
