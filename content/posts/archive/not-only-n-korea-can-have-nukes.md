A Wired [article](https://www.wired.com/news/conflict/0,2100,57792,00.html) describes an unbelievable story of reporter Noah Shachtman trivially breaching the physical security at none-other-than Los Alamos National Laboratory described as "the world's most important nuclear research facility".  
  
"On Saturday morning, I slipped into and out of a  
top-secret area of the lab while guards sat, unaware, less than a  
hundred yards away."
