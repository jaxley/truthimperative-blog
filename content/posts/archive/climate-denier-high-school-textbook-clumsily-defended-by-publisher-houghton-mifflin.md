[Think Progress » Blog Archive » Houghton Mifflin offers misleading defense for climate-denier high school textbook.](http://thinkprogress.org/2008/04/12/houghton-mifflin-defense/)  

> Houghton Mifflin issued this statement in response to the growing controversy: 

> The authors do not provide a history of global warming; rather they use the issue to illustrate “entrepreneurial politics.” As part of this illustration, the book cites a wide range of sources, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to Nobel Prize Winner Al Gore. Late last year, we released the 11th edition of “American Government,” which included some revisions to the “entrepreneurial politics” section. These revisions reflect current developments in environmental policy research.

Also, follow the link for a point-by-point debunking of the Houghton statement. Ugly anti-science. These guys are pitting climate change "skeptics" (aka deniers) on par with the consensus of scientific opinion on the matter. Typical ploy where a denier tries to make equivalent a small sect of skeptical voices against the tide of a scientific consensus on an issue as if there is equal weight.
