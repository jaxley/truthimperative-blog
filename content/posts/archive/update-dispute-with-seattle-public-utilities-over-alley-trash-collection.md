After importing, I did  not see a follow-up with the resolution got posted for [Dispute with Seattle Public Utilities over alley trash collection](https://truthimperative.axley.net/2010/05/dispute-with-seattle-public-utilities.html).  I swear I wrote one, but will write one for posterity.  
  
I contacted  
  
Since I spoke with Sierra, I received a call from John Herrick who supervises the inspectors. He was responding to my letter that I submitted on the SPU website, and to complaints from many of my other neighbors.  
  
He said that he is coming on site tomorrow (Thursday) with the contractor to look into the matter and he will get back to me by noon on Friday -- it sounded like with a decision. He assured me that our alley service would continue until further notice. He said that they had authorized switching from alley service to curb service several blocks south of my location. I'm not sure if either the city may have erred in lumping our alley in with that authorization, or whether the contractor misinterpreted what the city authorized or both. I'd be interested in finding out where the error occurred so that we can rest assured it won't happen again!
