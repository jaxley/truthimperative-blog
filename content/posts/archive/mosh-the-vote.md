[the politics of Mosh](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/10/27/1473/8436) is a great, in-depth review of Eminem's new video for the song "Mosh" that is now the top video at MTV. Whatever you may think of Eminem, his music is always forceful and powerful and this is no exception. The video is exquisite. You can watch it online at [http://www.gnn.tv/content/eminem\_mosh.html](http://www.gnn.tv/content/eminem_mosh.html)  
  
If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better  
They ain't gonna stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more then ever,  
They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go,  
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know  
Stomp, push up, mush, fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home
