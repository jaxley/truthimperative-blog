There are some companies that just should not be allowed anywhere near a UI.  Sun Microsystems, Oracle, and of course PeopleSoft (now part of Oracle) to name a few.  
  
Case in point is PeopleSoft (Oracle)  I happened to need to report some vacation time and noticed this gem that made me read the logic several times to make sure I chose correctly:

Okay, 99.9% of all other UIs would have the logic 180 degrees opposite of this (choose OK to continue, Cancel to go back).  But why be conventional when you can be obtuse?
