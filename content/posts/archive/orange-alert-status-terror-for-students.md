From RISKS 22.56  
  
"Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2003 05:46:37 -0500  
From: "Rebecca Mercuri"  
Subject: Risks of Doing Homework  
  
At the faculty meeting at Bryn Mawr College on 12 Feb 2003, we were  
informed that a student at Haverford (our affiliated College) was arrested over  
the weekend when he was trying to do his homework assignment in  
Philadelphia.  
As part of the Cities project, he was taking photographs of SEPTA (our  
regional transit authority) facilities when he was arrested, detained  
for a few hours, and eventually released. Haverford administration is working  
to try to ensure that this event not be a part of the student's permanent  
police record. Apparently taking photographs at transit facilities is  
cause for arrest during "Code Orange" alert, the authorities explained.  
Faculty were advised to be careful about assigning "field trip" projects during  
such alerts.
