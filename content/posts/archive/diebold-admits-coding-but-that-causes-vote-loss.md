Diebold originally blamed a glitch that lost votes on anti-virus software but it turns out it was due to a flaw causing votes to not be recorded to memory when uploading votes from the external cards. It's a wonder how something as simple as counting votes could have so many bugs in core functionality...  
  
Note to US Bank customers: Diebold makes many of their ATMs! Let's hope the accounting is better there.
