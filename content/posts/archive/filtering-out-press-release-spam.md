This may become useful.  I've actually gotten so annoyed at organizations that insist on sending at least one marketing email per day that I had to unsubscribe from all of their mailings to get some peace of mind.  Restoration Hardware, America's Test Kitchen, Costco are three of the big offenders that drive me crazy.
