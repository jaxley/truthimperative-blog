McCain once had words of praise for Senator Kerry, but he played the repugnican party line during the election and trashed him for his botched joke--acting as if he really believed Kerry, a decorated veteran, was actually disparaging the troops and not Bush.  Politics is disgusting.  McCain should take what Olbermann said about Rove and Bush to heart:
