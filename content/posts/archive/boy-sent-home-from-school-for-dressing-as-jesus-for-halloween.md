This is truly ridiculous.  The constitutional prohibitions against schools endorsing religion do not extend to what the students choose to do.  This is the wrong move from a first amendment standpoint.  So before the religulous get in a huff about how the government is trying to get religion out of our schools, etc., I agree with you that they should not have done this.  But, this was not an issue of state-sponsored-religion.  
  
I still want to dress as Jesus on the bus to work one of these years...
