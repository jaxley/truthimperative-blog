It is truly a fallacy the people putting forth the talking point that the differences in state breach notification laws need to be "fixed" with a federal law that usurps all state laws.  If you look at the two page chart, it really is not that difficult to know what to do.  You end up just taking the "expedient common denominator".  These are handy reference charts for your cube at work.
