But you have to be a believer or it won't work.  Well, even then it won't work.   
  
I wonder what kind of anti-scientific process that lead someone to postulate that it isn't enough to just \_pray\_ to St. Joseph -- no -- you have to a) make a mini-me version of him  
b) bury him in your yard  
c) Oh, don't forget the most important part -- bury him \_upside down\_.  
  
Funny how products you buy on TV from hacks have a supposed "Guaranteed to work or your money back" promise, yet religious cruft from the local "Christan Supply" store doesn't...  Think about it...
