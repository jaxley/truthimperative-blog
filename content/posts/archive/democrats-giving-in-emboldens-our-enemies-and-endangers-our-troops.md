That's right spineless Democrats.  By giving Bush the extra funding supplemental for the Iraq war, you've sent a message to our enemies that we're not leaving any time soon, which is likely to make us and the troops \_less safe\_.  Why can't you people get the message out that extending the war "emboldens our enemies" to counter the falsehood that it's the timetables that do this?  Sheesh.  And you wonder why they can barely win even in an environment like this.
