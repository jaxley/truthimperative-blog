[Think Progress » Senior Bush Appointee Rejected Scientists’ Recommendations In Favor Of Industry Positions](http://thinkprogress.org/2006/10/30/macdonald-endangered-species/)  
  

> Julie MacDonald, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, has consistently "[rejected staff scientists' recommendations](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/29/AR2006102900776.html) to protect imperiled animals and plants under the Endangered Species Act." A civil engineer with no training in biology, she has overruled and disparaged the findings of her staff, instead relying on the recommendations of political and industry groups.
