Recently learned about this on History Detectives. More evidence of the kind of crap we have to deal with because of the mixing of religion and politics and our puritanical heritage...  
  
The 1916 Lady Liberty coin featured a design of Lady Liberty exposing one breast.&nbsp; There was outrage of this being "obscene" and in 1917 the breast was covered in a coat of mail.&nbsp; I wonder if John Ashcroft's relatives were involved with this controversy?
