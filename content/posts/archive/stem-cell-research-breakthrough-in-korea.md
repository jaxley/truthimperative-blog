[WorldNetDaily: Paraplegic breakthrough using adult stem cells](https://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=46546 "WorldNetDaily: Paraplegic breakthrough using adult stem cells")  
  
This is truly great news and will be even better if it holds up to peer review and brings about additional breakthroughs. It is proof positive of a couple of things:  
  

  
*   The critical importance of stem cell research of all kinds for treating serious afflictions and diseases. The research here was done using adult stem cells, but embryonic stem cell research may hold even more promise for finding cures in general.  
    
*   The fact that this breakthrough came from outside the US is a warning of the failure of the US policy on stem cell research and the republicans likening "stem cells" to abortion and creating a false stigma.
