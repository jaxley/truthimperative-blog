[Scalia's Right, It's All Perfectly Legal to Kill An Innocent Man | Crooks and Liars](http://crooksandliars.com/susie-madrak/scalias-right-its-all-perfectly-legal)  
  
So, the supreme court is not getting involved with a case where a man in Georgia is likely able to prove his innocence even though he will end up being wrongly put to death.  This case sounds so eerily familiar to the true story The Innocent Man.  At least there was some actual dissent among the justices on this one.  
  
What is it with the south and wrongful convictions though?  Grisham's book was about a case in Oklahoma where their appellate courts almost rubber-stamp-ignored the attempts to hear the exonerating evidence for decades.  The man was finally saved hours before he was to be put to death.
