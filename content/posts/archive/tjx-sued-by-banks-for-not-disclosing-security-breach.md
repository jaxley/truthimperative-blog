TJX sat for months knowing full well they had been breached but didn't notify anyone.  The downstream impacts for issuers alone are potentially huge.  What do you do knowing that you have a list of customers whose cards you know were breached?  Do you replace them all as a precaution?  Who pays for that cost?  Or do you monitor and hope for the best?  Who pays for the cost of the added monitoring?
