"Federal Legislation Introduced!  
  
Rep. Rush Holt of New Jersey has introduced a bill requiring a voter-verifiable paper trail.  
  
[https://holt.house.gov/issues2.cfm?id=5996](https://holt.house.gov/issues2.cfm?id=5996)  
  
The Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2003.  
  
"We cannot afford nor can we permit another major assault on the integrity of the American electoral process," said Rep. Rush Holt. "Imagine it's Election Day 2004. You enter your local polling place and go to cast your vote on a brand new 'touch screen' voting machine. The screen says your vote has been counted. As you exit the voting booth, however, you begin to wonder. How do I know if the machine actually recorded my vote? The fact is, you don't."  
  
Folks, this is what we've been waiting for! Please contact your U.S. Representative ASAP and ask them to support this bill and consider co-sponsoring it.  
  
Let everyone know about this pending legislation."
