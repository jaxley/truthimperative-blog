It's not really a typo but an intentionally left-out X separator for  
aesthetics on the sculpture that was intended to result in gibberish  
when decrypted that would clue in the decryptors to reinsert a separator  
and try again, except it ended up spelling something intelligible  
instead of garbage so they thought they had decrypted it properly!

> For nearly 16 years, puzzle enthusiasts have labored to decipher an 865-character coded message stenciled into a sculpture on the grounds of the Central Intelligence Agency's headquarters in Langley, Va. This week, the sculptor gave them an unsettling but hopeful surprise: part of the message they thought they had deciphered years ago actually says something else.
