DRM is getting even more annoying, dangerous, and insidious. Intuit thought that it would be necessary to utilize a product called SafeCast to prevent unauthorized copying of its popular TurboTax product. Extremetech did some testing and found that SafeCast copy (not _copyright_) protection relied on modifying sector 33 on your hard drive outside of your operating system. This is not necessarily a Good Thing â„¢

What to do now? Should you use TurboTax or switch to a competitor's product? Well, Intuit has been listening to the complaints and have offered some concessions, including assurance that a version of TurboTax that won't require "activation" to utilize will be released after October 2003, allowing SafeCast to be uninstalled when TurboTax is uninstalled.
