Medical practice quackery has to be reported to the FTC, [http://www.ftc.gov/ftc/contact.shtm](http://www.ftc.gov/ftc/contact.shtm) as I just did to a chiropractor that claimed they could help with "ADHD", "Bedwetting", "PMS", "Asthma", "Ear infections", "Colic", and even "Allergies" The FTC "wizard" is a bit cumbersome, but you eventually get 3500 characters to describe your complaint after about 50 clicks.

Update: Forgot to link to a great paper summarizing the common false claims made and a summary of the current evidence for each claim from the New Zealand Medical Journal [Chiropractic claims in the English-speaking world](http://www.dcscience.net/Ernst-Gilbey-Chiropractic-claims-NZMJ.pdf)
