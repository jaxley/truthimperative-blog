Well, he remote viewed the answer, but only used his superhuman crypto skills; nothing paranormal. [Bit commitment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_commitment) schemes are pretty useful in cryptography.Â  But, you have to do them correctly.

Matt made a great observation in his message about this that goes along with my recent post about [Crypto Maxims](http://www.blogger.com/archives/2007/05/cryptomaxims_fo.html) I can say that many of the crypto APIs I have seen are either too complicated to get right unless you are an expert, or they allow easy access to crypto primitives such that programmers are often compelled to make mistakes by oversimplifying a complex solution and not knowing what they are missing. Getting more of this information out of academic papers and into the hands of practitioners and API / framework designers would be a big win for the security field.
