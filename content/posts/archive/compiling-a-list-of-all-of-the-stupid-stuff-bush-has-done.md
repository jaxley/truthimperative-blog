"Let's create a list of every idiotic thing George Bush has done in the past five years"  
  
This is a great idea. I've wanted to at least put together a list of the biggest scandals.  
  
Great timing for this kind of fun. On the heels of a new set of [(dis)approval rating results](https://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=271) that show that Bush's popularity has fallen AGAIN, to its lowest level. So, I'll add his claim that he was given a "mandate" to the list of stupid shit he has said or done.
