Stephen Hawking asked a great question: [Yahoo! Answers - How can the human race survive the next hundred years?](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AtjblpXOSMXPaKrJ2N9lui8jzKIX?qid=20060704195516AAnrdOD "Yahoo! Answers - How can the human race survive the next hundred years?")  
  
He also made the news recently after a speech in China where he mentioned that he liked [Chinese women](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-06/21/content_622829.htm) The Daily Show had lots of fun with that, especially the longing look he appears to be giving the woman standing next to him.
