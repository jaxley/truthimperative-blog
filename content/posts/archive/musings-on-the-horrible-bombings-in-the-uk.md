I hope we have better reason to suspect Al-Qaida than this. And can't the press do better than push a ridiculous assertion such as this below with a weak justification by an anonymous source? Why the need for an anonymouse source anyhow? It almost seems as if the reporter was trying to squeeze in a link to Al-Qaida no matter the questionable "logic" being used to make that assertion. But, perhaps it came off this way due to too much pruning by the editor.

So, are there not any other terrorist groups that can be "well-coordinated" and "fairly sophisticated"?  
  
Seeing that the terror alert level was only raised **_after_** the bombings occurred indicates that our intelligence is still in pretty bad shape. I'm sure that if the US knew about a threat against the UK in advance, they would have raised our alert level in anticipation.
