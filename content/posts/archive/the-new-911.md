[Legal Fiction: THE TWO 9/11s](https://lawandpolitics.blogspot.com/2006_09_01_lawandpolitics_archive.html#115794363495869773 "Legal Fiction")

> the second 9/11 is the political prop — a mangled, grotesque doppelganger of the first one that has been whored out on the political street for over four years now. The second 9/11 is the source of policies that have made the world far worse, and have killed many times the number of people who died in the Towers. And so, what’s truly tragic about the second 9/11 is that it threatens to forever stain the legacy of the first 9/11  

  
  
Indeed. How hard was it to find a radio/TV station that wasn't pushing 9/11 in your face? Who wants to hear another fearmongering speech by W? Not I.
