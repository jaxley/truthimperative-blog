I no longer work for a large US cellular company, so I am free to write about this topic. Even better, I can write about how the lobbying by the cellular phone industry has been what keeps laws from being enacted to protect the public. Now, I do agree with the position that there are a lot of things drivers do that are just as bad, if not worse (reading the newspaper on your steering wheel, reading email on a blackberry...) so why pick on cellphones, but the fact is that from a public threat perspective, there are way more people doing stupid shit while on their cellphone than all other distracted driving combined, I guarantee.  
  
I have made it a habit to note how many drivers doing stupid shit are talking on their cellphones when I see them and it is, no joke, almost 100% of drivers. I challenge you to do the same and you'll be horrified at how many common dangerous and annoying things are related to being on a cell phone at the time:  
  

  
*   Driving too slow
  
*   Unable to stay in lane
  
*   Swerving
  
*   Not letting you merge (not paying attention)
  
*   Etc. etc.
