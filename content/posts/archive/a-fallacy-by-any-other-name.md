[But this here herring is so obviously red at Pandagon](http://pandagon.net/2006/06/17/but-this-here-herring-is-so-obviously-red/ "But this here herring is so obviously red at Pandagon")  
  
I love the way they cut through the bullshit in this argument and reveal the naked fallacy underpinning it. It is a shame when proponents use the fact that society (wrongly) denigrates some activity (prostitution, homosexuality, gay marriage, being single, being a nontheist, etc.) that in itself has nothing to do with them and on its face is not "immoral" and has nothing to do with those who denigrate it and then writes off the fact that those engaging in the activity get victimized (wrongly) by saying that they knew the consequences ahead of time, so what's the big deal? Really irritating tactics.
