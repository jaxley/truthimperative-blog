> (18 April 2006)  
> Microsoft plans to retire support for Windows 98, Windows 98 SE and Windows ME on July 11, 2006; after that date, there will be no more security updates for these versions of the company's operating systems.  
> Microsoft calls these systems "outdated" and recommends that users upgrade to a more secure operating system, such as Windows XP.
