Seems as if the Bush Administration has a habit of leaking confidential information.  
  

>   
> ABC News just reported that the British authorities say they have evidence that the London attacks last week were an operation planned by Al Qaeda for the last two years. This was an operation the Brits thought they caught and stopped in time, but they were wrong. The piece of the puzzle ABC missed is that this is an operation the Bush administration helped botch last year.

I agree with the senator. We **_had_** an operative INSIDE Al Qaida! And this leak destroyed that advantage that may have helped prevent not only this attack, but other future attacks.
