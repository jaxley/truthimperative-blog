[NPR : There Is No God](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5015557 "NPR : There Is No God")  
  
Just in time for the holidays, a piece on what people believe that is not necessarily in the mainstream. A good reminder that not everyone believes the same as you do, especially among the "christian" religions.  
  
Penn Jillette wrote an excellent piece for [NPR's "This I Believe" series](https://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=4538138) on why he is "beyond Atheism". Many religious people don't understand or simply don't believe that you can have morals without god but I think that Penn has a very simple model that explains how there are even possible advantages to the atheist moral world view:  
  

>   
> Believing there's no God means I can't really be forgiven except by kindness and faulty memories. That's good; it makes me want to be more thoughtful. I have to try to treat people right the first time around.  

  
  
He also discusses many other advantages to a godless world that are well worth reading, especially if you are religious; not because it should convince you to not be religious but because it can help you understand that it is just as legitimate a position as your religious position. And hopefully soften some of the anti-atheist views held by most of America.
