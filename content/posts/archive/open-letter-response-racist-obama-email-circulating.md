I had to respond to this email.; It made me so angry that such lies and racist  
remarks get passed around so carelessly.&nbsp; People don't think that forwarding  
a simple email could possibly be harmful.&nbsp; Well, these falsehoods are making  
their way to other people and they are changing people's voting plans.&nbsp;  
  
This is just \_one example\_ of where people have believed this Internet filth:

There is \_real harm\_ from forwarding falsehoods on the Internet.&nbsp; Stop them before  
they destroy anyone else's life or reputation.  
  
And for Allah's sake, do some freaking research before forwarding crap!!!  
  
\= My response:  
  
This is one of the most outrageous, racist (against Obama and blacks) and  
patently false emails I have seen in a while. It is roundly debunked on  
every level. And it only takes a couple seconds to check Snopes and even  
Google!  
  
Refuse to be part of any swiftboat-style smear campaign based on lies and  
racist propaganda such as this.

**ORIGINAL, DESPICABLE, UNTRUE CHAIN EMAIL:**  

****Obama mentioned his church during his appearance with Oprah. It's the****  _**_Trinity_**_  _**_Church_**_  _**_of Christ_**_****. I found this interesting.****

****&nbsp;****

****&nbsp;****

****&nbsp;****

****Ob********ama's church:****

****&nbsp;****

****&nbsp;****

****Please read and go to this church's website and read what is written there. I checked the church website and what I found is very alarming.****

**&nbsp;**

&nbsp;

**Barack Obama**  ****is a member of this church and is running for President of the****  ****U.S.****  ****If you look at the first page of their website, you will learn that this congregation has a non-negotiable commitment to****  **Africa******. No where is****  ****AMERICA****  ****even mentioned. Notice too, what color you will need to be if you should want to join Obama's church... !!! Doesn't look like his choice of religion has improved much over his (former?) Muslim upbringing. Are you aware that Obama's middle name is Hussein? Strip away his nice looks, the big smile and smooth talk and what do you get? Certainly a racist, as plainly defined by the stated position of his church! And possibly a covert worshiper of the Muslim faith, even today. This guy desires to rule over********America**** ****while his loyalty is totally vested in a Black****  ****Africa********! I cannot believe this has not been all over the TV and newspapers. This is why it is so important to pass this message along to all of our family &amp; friends. To think that Obama has even the slightest chance in the run for the presidency, is really scary.****
