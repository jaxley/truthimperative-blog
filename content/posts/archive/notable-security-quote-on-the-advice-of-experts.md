> If you're sick and you go to a doctor, do you tell the doctor "you'd better come up with some very clear arguments if you want me to follow your advice"?  Do you tell your doctor "you'd better build a strong case before I will listen to you"?  I would hope not.  That would be silly.  
> Doctors are medical professionals with a great deal of training and expertise in the subject.  They can speak with authority when it comes to your health.  So why do people with no training in security think that they can freely ignore the advice of security professionals without any negative consequences?
