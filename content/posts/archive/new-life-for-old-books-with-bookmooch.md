I am loving Bookmooch. I've mailed out several books so far that were sitting in my basement and am going to hopefully get some good ones in return. This was a great idea that my friend [Mike](https://ring.org) and I actually had in college after the annoyance of paying $60 for a book that the bookstore on campus would only buy back for a pittance; only to turn around and sell it for $60 again. I'm glad someone else coded it. Maybe I'll actually get something for those books I chose to keep rather than get loose change for.
