I had one of the worst mondays in a while.  
  
I was not feeling well but went to work anyway (I thought of resting up one more day and probably should have stayed in bed).  
  
It was the first day back to work after being sick with fever for 3 days.  
  
On my way to the bus stop, after only a 1/2 block from my house, my pants were soaked and shoes soaked through. The rain and wind has been insufferable this fall!  
I reluctantly went back home frustrated and not knowing if there was a way to possibly get to work but not be soaking wet all day. I decided the strategy would be sacrificial clothing. I geared up in my Costa Rica Rain forest gear (all drip-dry) and packed a new dry outfit to change into at work, including new shoes.  
  
Well, the sack that I put my shoes in got a hole worn in it on the way to and from the bus. One shoe fell out on the sidewalk coming into my work building. Fortunately, someone saw it right away and alerted me.  
  
When I went to put my shoes on, one shoe got laces worn in half from dragging behind my wheeled laptop bag.  
  
Turns out my laptop bag was not waterproof so my dry pants got wet.  
  
Turns out my brand new building downtown Seattle has no hand dryers in the new bathrooms! So, I couldn't quickly dry my new pants.  
  
So, I was stuck with wearing my rain pants while I waited for my others to dry out.  
  
But those pants were still damp enough that they got my chair wet. So I had to switch chairs for the day after putting my dry pants on to avoid getting those wet again.  
  
Ugh.
