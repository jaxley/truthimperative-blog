I get at least 400 spam emails every day.  Until I get my new filter setup better trained, I've had to manually review my spam folder more than I've had to with my older system.  It is illuminating seeing many of the patterns that show up, but in the past month, these are the most frequently seen institutions:  

*   BB&T (Branch Banking & Trust Company)
*   PayPal
*   National City bank
*   Regions Bank
*   Aegis Capital Group

I'm also getting tons of spam referring to the recipient as Rickie Peters.  Who the hell is this and why would this be a good tactic for the spammers.  That isn't me, BTW.
