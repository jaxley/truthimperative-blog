FYI.Â  Kind of annoying since I have to look in my mail logs to double-check if a critical message actually went out.  
  
[I use Gmail-Googlemail, but I can't tell if any of my messages have been posted to the list - Documentation - Confluence](https://wiki.list.org/display/DOC/I+use+Gmail-Googlemail%2C+but+I+can%27t+tell+if+any+of+my+messages+have+been+posted+to+the+list;jsessionid=615DCA3146D7A6F127907F698674F799)
