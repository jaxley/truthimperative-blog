So, I was on myspace inviting other members of my mentoring group to our myspace group when I noticed a posting by Death Cab For Cutie,  

*   ##### [Death Cab for Cutie](https://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=2902722) posted new blog entries: [Chris Walla featured in Myspace.com’s "Front To Back"](https://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=2902722&blogID=443267619) and [Chris Walla campaigning for Obama](https://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=2902722&blogID=443290264)
    

I thought, "Wait a minute.  There can't be more than one Chris Walla."  Well, there may be, but I know this one.  I googled him to find a photo and more information -- sure enough, he's a friend of mine from Bothell High School that I used to play guitar with in a couple bands.  And now, he is the producer and guitarist for Death Cab For Cutie.  How did I not know this?  His [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Walla) also mentions his stint with a band, The Wallflowers (no, not the famous one of the same name).  I was in that band myself for a short time.  It was in the days before I had truly discovered Indie rock though so was not a good fit at the time.  He has also done lots of work with another favorite band of mine, The Decemberists, from Portland, OR.  Insane!  
  
I also found out that he's still in touch with another High School friend, Nathan Goode, who was one of the best drummers I had ever seen.  Chris, Nate, my friend Mike, Jerod and I used to all play together at Nate's house or in my backyard shed -- it was a lot of fun.  
  
Crazy!  Well, maybe there is still hope of quitting my job and being a rockstar after all...
