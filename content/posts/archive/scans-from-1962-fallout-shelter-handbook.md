I've been working on emergency preparedness for my neighborhood lately so this is very apropos.  
  
BTW, I found a $79.99 Ready kit at Home Depot that is a pretty good deal for a 2-person 72 hour kit (what is recommended for personal preparedness at a minimum). Don't forget supplies for your pets too!
