Senator Ron Wyden (D) from Oregon is pitching a simple idea to lead to a market-driven solution to the DRM problems being imposed on consumers: to require music companies to disclose to consumers the restrictions they will impose on the consumer's use of the product.  
  
"When customers know, for example, that the compact disc they're buying is technologically rigged so they can't rip MP3 files from it for use on a portable player, they won't buy it. Eventually, these informed customers will demand change in the copyright laws."
