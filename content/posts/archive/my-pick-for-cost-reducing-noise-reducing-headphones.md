[Aiwa HP-CN6](https://www.us.aiwa.com/default.asp?page=products&action=viewProduct&prod=17) Noise-cancelling headphones. Get them at [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000220DCG/juxtaposition-20/102-8676820-4806515?dev-t=1B7AVRRGVX9PB4T4ZD02%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2) for super cheap. I compared these to the $299 Bose and it was a very easy decision. There is not $270 more noise cancelling in the Bose headphones.  
  
When trying them on and comparing them, be aware that the over-the-ear designs block more noise just without having them turned on. So, account for that difference in your testing.  
  
I often use mine at work to cancel out the subconsciously irritating ambient noise and they are indispensable on airplanes.
