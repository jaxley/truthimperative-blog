A couple of cool sites that I've come across recently  
  
[\- Science Facts, science trivia, science info](https://www.firstscience.com/SITE/factfile/factfile1_20.asp)  
  
Science news and loads of interesting facts, like this one:  

> Each King in a deck of playing cards represents a great king from history. Spades - King David; Clubs - Alexander the Great; Hearts - Charlemagne; and Diamonds - Julius Caesar.

[Wordle - Beautiful Word Clouds](https://wordle.net/)  

> Wordle is a toy for generating “word clouds” from text that you provide. The clouds give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in the source text. You can tweak your clouds with different fonts, layouts, and color schemes. The images you create with Wordle are yours to use however you like. You can print them out, or save them to the Wordle gallery to share with your friends.  

  
  
Very interesting tool to create word clouds. I may throw resumes through this to see what kinds of patterns emerge about the person. I saw this used to compare the VP debate transcripts for each candidate.
