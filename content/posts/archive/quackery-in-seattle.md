I often listen to [AM 1090 Seattle](https://am1090seattle.com/) (upstart progressive talk radio station and Air America / Nova M radio  
affiliate).  What irks me are the many fringe/quack commercials and infomercials that air on the station.  I don't see many of the vendors listed on their sponsor pages so I'm not sure if they are just forwarding commercials from the networks, but I wish they would take a little more editorial control.  
  
What doesn't help is that one of their prominent talk show hosts (that I actually like for his political acumen and rational take on issues) [Thom Hartman](https://www.thomhartmann.com/) tends to shill for many questionable products.  He seems fairly  
gullible outside of the political sphere.  And this seems to only be reinforced now that I found that he owns his own company producing ADHD herbal treatments:  [Enzymatic Therapy, Inc. - North America's leading manufacturer and distributor of dietary supplements and natural medicines.](https://www.enzymatictherapy.com/) Seriously -- if there was something to what he discovered, it should result in a pharmaceutical product regulated by the FDA and controlled in dosage with well-done and documented trials to prove efficacy. Products that go the "natural" route don't have that kind of rigor and actual evidence backing them.  
  
Some of the products featured that are total quackery (not science-based medicine):  
  
[Evercleanse](https://evercleanse.com/)  
which claims to rid you of "the five to twenty five pounds of waste that some experts say is trapped on the colon walls like spackle or paste"  This is a typical quack claim.  Anyone who has gotten a colonoscopy can tell you that you actually don't have "pounds" of stuff on your colon walls.  Your body expels solid waste fairly well, unless you have an obstructed bowel.  Then you would need serious medical attention, not some supplement that is not even regulated by the FDA. See [How Clean Should Your Colon Be?](https://www.acsh.org/factsfears/newsID.194/news_detail.asp) (The American Council on Science and Health)  
  
[Super Beta Prostate](https://www.betaprostate.com/),  
formulated by Roger Mason, who has the book quackishly-titled, "The Natural Prostate Cure" and even one entitled "The Natural Diabetes Cure".  Do you think if someone had a "cure" for these diseases, especially one that was over-the-counter, that this would be HUGE news that the scientific and lay press would take a big interest in.  Not to mention the pharmaceutical companies that would love to synthesize a  
cancer treatment.  
  
I found this [review from amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/Natural-Prostate-Cure-Roger-Mason/dp/1884820611) funny and to-the-point:  
  

> Roger Mason's little pamphlet has some serious flaws in it. He proclaims that the way to beat **prostate**  
> cancer is to eliminate meat and dairy in favor of whole grains and  
> vegetables. His authority for this is that a grain based diet is what  
> mankind has been consuming throughout recorded history.  
> This is  
> falacious reasoning at best. Archaeologists can tell him that they can  
> determine the eating habits from ancient skeletal remains by  
> examination of the teeth. Healthy, undecayed teeth are indicative of  
> someone whose diet was primarily meat; while teeth that demonstrate  
> considerable deterioration proves that their diet was primarily grains.  
> Why is it that grains do that and meat doesn't?! In addition, they  
> might also reveal that the **natural**  
> mode of human biology is for a mother to nurse for up to three years  
> and remain infertile throughout that time; while a grain based diet  
> interferes with the **natural**  
> biological cycle and returns a woman to fertility in as little as three  
> months despite nursing an extant child. Mason should also explain why  
> humans have incisors...  
>   
> The Atkins diet plan is juxtaposed to Mason's views. It emphasizes the more **natural**  
> diet of meat and de-emphasizes grains and starches as the heaviest  
> carbohydrates. The results are startling - reduced weight and  
> cholesterol despite eating MORE red meat! Carbs get stored in fat cells  
> when there is an overabunbance. That leads to disease. The human body  
> can't store extra protein. It's the extra carbs that cause an  
> oversupply of estrogen in men, not the consumption of protein as Mason

>

Regardless, the main ingredients in SBP are Beta-sitosterols and the  
website claims that one capsule is equivalent to 100 typical Saw  
Palmetto capsules for the amount of Beta-sitosterols.  So, one could  
look at the efficacy (or lack thereof) of Saw Palmetto then to help  
determine whether SBP could conceivably have any benefit.  As recently  
as 2006 there was a large study that seemed to show (as is typical when  
the effect is not real) the larger, well-done study tends not to show  
an effect.  Meaning, that it is unlikely that saw palmetto and its  
ingredients would be a good anti-cancer therapy.
