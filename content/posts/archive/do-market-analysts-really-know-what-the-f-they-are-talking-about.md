After seeing these headlines in the news and RSS news feeds (many of the AP headlines \_changed\_ from one day to the next, but thanks to RSS readers every change was logged as a "new" entry so the full history of the headlines was preserved for your enjoyment below), I have to think the answer is "hell no".  
  
How could oil and gas prices both be categorized as rising and falling, rebounding and tumbling, and then the reasons for this ranging from "weak demand" to "supply from OPEC" to "storage crunch" to "Bernanke's comments" to "US earnings"? And that was just within a span of \_5 days\_.
