A recent Pew research study shows that viewers of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report are more informed about current events than "average consumers of NBC, ABC, Fox News, CNN, C-SPAN and daily newspapers." Pathetic.  
  
e.g.  

> “**Thirty percent** of Daily Show and **34 percent** of Colbert viewers **correctly identified Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice**, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and **the majority party in the U.S. House of Representatives**”  

[Think Progress » Colbert, Stewart viewers more well-informed than those watching O’Reilly, Dobbs.](http://thinkprogress.org/2008/08/18/stewart-colbert-oreilly-dobbs/)
