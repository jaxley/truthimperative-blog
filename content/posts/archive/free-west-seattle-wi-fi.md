Finally got a secondary wi-fi setup at home for guests, iPhone users, and neighbors who need to borrow it.  Like Bruce Schneier, I just think it's the neighborly thing to do.  Until now, I couldn't allow it because my main wi-fi needs encryption to keep interlopers off my LAN.  But, the secondary wi-fi is in a DMZ so all that is accessible is the Internet.  
  
SSID:  hellohansenview  
  
Enjoy!  
  
\* Hansen View is the official name of my neighborhood.  
  
Curious if anyone else out there vends open wi-fi for the interloper?  
  
I've borrowed some neighbor's open linksys many a time to get info on the Internet when my DSL is down.  But these days, most are encrypted, which makes me sad.
