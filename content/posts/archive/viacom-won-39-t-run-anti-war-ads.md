With all of the millions of protesters out there this weekend, you would think that Viacom would not be opposed to a fairly popular viewpoint being broadcast. However, they have refused to run an anti-war ad by [MoveOn.org](moveon.org) and have given an alleged lame rationale.  
  
The organization was going to pay for the ads just like any other entity would. Interestingly, "According to Boyd, the donations came rolling inï¿½after just two hours the group had met its goal." They raised $75,000 through an e-mail campaign in 2 hours!

Viacom won't run the ad but you can view it on MoveOn.org's website.
