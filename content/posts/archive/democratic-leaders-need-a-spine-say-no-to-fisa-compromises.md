This points out how the Democrats aren't capitalizing on this issue which is working against the Republicans. Show how the Democratic party is about freedom and the Republicans are about unitary executive and a police state.

Now, take some action and tell your congresscritters to take a stand on our rights. Thanks to CREDO Mobile!

> For over 30 years, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) has dictated necessary and appropriate ways for the U.S. government to collect intelligence on its own citizens for the sake of national security. Two key provisions of this law are that:  
>   
> \* The government must obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before spying on a citizen.  
> \* Citizens have the right to sue if they believe they were spied upon illegally.  
>   
> FISA provided broad leeway for every President from Carter to Clinton to conduct extensive intelligence-gathering operations. However, President Bush has decided that he is above warrants and judicial review, and major newspapers have reported that he has been using big telecoms like AT&T to spy on Americans without warrants for years.
