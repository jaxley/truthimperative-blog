Best quote:  
  
"Whenever someone thinks that they can replace SSL/SSH with something  
much better that they designed this morning over coffee, their computer  
speakers should generate some sort of penis-shaped sound wave and plunge it repeatedly into their skulls until they achieve enlightenment."
