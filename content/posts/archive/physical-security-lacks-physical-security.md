I can't believe that these systems have such a horrible design!  
  
Basically, these guys showed how you can inject a tiny device that can record the data that the scanner reads in such that you can create devices to replay it later.

(Franken manages an IT company in London. Like many Defcon presenters, he asked for restricted identification.)

The quick connect device contains a small, programmable microcontroller called a PIC chip. In a nutshell, pop the plastic cover, pull the wire, snip, snip, snap on your quick connect, seal it up, pass your proximity card, green blink, and—bzzzzt—you're in.
