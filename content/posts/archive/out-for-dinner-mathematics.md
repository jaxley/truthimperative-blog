This is very interesting. Supposedly only works in 2003. Anyone have the mathematical basis for this? I have a whole book with cool calculator games somewhere...

DON'T CHEAT BY SCROLLING DOWN FIRST  
  
It takes less than a minute.......  
  
Work this out as you read.  
  
Be sure you don't read the bottom until you've worked it out!  
  
This is not one of those waste of time things, it's fun.  
  
1\. First of all, pick the number of times a week that you would like to  
have dinner out. (try for more than once but less than 10)  
  
2\. Multiply this number by 2 (Just to be bold)  
  
  
3\. Add 5. (for Sunday)  
  
  
4\. Multiply it by 50 - I'll wait while you get the  
calculator................  
  
  
5\. If you have already had your birthday this year add 1753.... If you  
haven't, add 1752..........  
  
  
6.. Now subtract the four digit year that you were born.  
  
  
You should have a three digit number .  
  
  
  
The first digit of this was your original number  
  
(I.e., how many times you want to have eat out each week.)  
  
  
The next two numbers are...  
  
  
  
YOUR AGE! (Oh YES, it IS!!!!!)  
  
THIS IS THE ONLY YEAR (2003) IT WILL EVER WORK, SO SPREAD IT AROUND  
WHILE IT LASTS. IMPRESSIVE, ISN'T IT?
