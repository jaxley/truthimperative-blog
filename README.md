# The Truth Imperative blog

[![Build and deploy to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/jaxley/truthimperative-blog/actions/workflows/build-to-gh-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaxley/truthimperative-blog/actions/workflows/build-to-gh-pages.yml)

- This blog is using a version of the [lwojcik/eleventy-template-bliss: Single-column blog template for Eleventy focused on simplicity without sacrificing functionality](https://github.com/lwojcik/eleventy-template-bliss/)
- The blog content is copyrighted by me.
- I use Obsidian templates to compose blog posts and manage drafts.
